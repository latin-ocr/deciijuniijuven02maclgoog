xviii IN'l'ItODUGTION.

Armenia was finally subdued by Trajan In v. 120 the same Marius
is referred to as having ‘nuper’ stripped the Africana. But ‘nuper’ is
used with much latitudo, and the name of Marius was long held in
remembrance as the great spoiler of provinces, having been made more
notorious through the celebrity of Tacitus the historian and Pliny the
younger, who were employed to prosecute him, just as the speeehes of
Burke and Sheridan against Warren Hestings have perpetuated and
spread the ill-fame of his Indian govemment.

It is certain that the fourth Satira was written after the death of
Domitian, an. 96, since his death is expressly mentioned in the last two
versos. This Satire therefore may be assigned to the reign of Nerva
from September, nn. 96, to danuary, an. 98, or very early in his suc·
eessor Trajanh reign. The subject would only amuse soon after the

. tyraut's death.

The twelfth Satire, which refers to 'l'rajan's basin in the Portus
Augusti (v. 75, δια), must have been written in his reign or after it.
This argument assumes what there is no good reason to doubt, that the

· Scholiast is right in attributing this work to Trajan'.

According to these calculatione eight out of the sixteen Satires were '
written after the death of Domitian. The sixteenth is a fragment, and
it may be admitted that, if not the last written, it was not begun very
long before the last, whlehever that may have been. Thus more than
half the extant Satires were written, as I suppose, between an. 96 and
s.n.120,or some of them possibly a little later, aperiod of at least
twenty-four years. ἵ

If any credit is due t'o the statement of the Grammarians, in which ¹
they all agree, that Juvenal did not begin to write in this style till he
was near middle life, we may suppose that none of the Satires were
written much before the death 'of Domitian. We cannot tell how long
the vigorous spirit that appears in all these poems may last, and show
itself in compositione of this sort'. It is no argument to say that Horace
soon got tired of Satira. His mind and circumstances were very diffe-
rent from Juvenal's. But twenty-four years after the period of middle
life carries a man on to an age when, under almost any circumstances, ,
the mind loses its freshness and seeks rest, at least from the excitament l
of such compositions3 and I think Juvenal could not heve been more
than forty, and probably not so much, when Domitian died. This may
be affirmed whether the Grammarians have stated the truth on the
above point or not, if my calculatione are not altogether wrong. This

⁹ Cramer (Italy, ii. 14) thinks the Scholiest has confounded this worlr wlth the har·
bour of Cmtnmcellae (lelta Veeehia), which was constructed by 'lh-aian ς bnt Sir W. ,
