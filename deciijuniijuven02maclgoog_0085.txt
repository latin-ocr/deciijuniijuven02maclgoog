D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Unde nefas tantum Latiis pastoribus? unde

Haec tetigit, Gradive, tuos urtica nepotes?

Traditur ecee viro clarus genere atque opibus vir:

Nec galeam quassae, nec terram cuspide pulsas, 130

Neo quereris patri? Vade ergo et cede severi

Jugeribus campi quem negligis ! “Officium oras

Primo sole mihi peragendum in valle Quirini?

Quae causa officii? “Quid quaeris? Nubit anricus,

Nec multos adhibet.’' Liceat modo vivere, fient, 1³5
, Fient ista palam cupient et in acta referri.

Interea tormentum ingens nubentibus haeret

Quod nequeunt parere et partu retinere marites.
