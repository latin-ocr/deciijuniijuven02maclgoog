leem the Stolo philosophy. He uss ο notive of οπο of tho two plsoes in Libyn nsmod
Leptis (Κορνοῦτος Λεοτοτηο φιλόσοφος· ἡ sinino οολιοΛοβιπιο. Suidss, Κορνοῦοοο).
Ηίο ποιπο shows him to heve been ο freedmuu of οπο of the sunsei, of whioh family
there were many weulthy brunohes. Seneeu sves one of them, οπο wss ο friend of
Cornutus. The poet Luoeu wss οπ Anum οπο οπο of his pupils Dion cneius
(62, o. 29) says thet Nero, intending to write ο Roman history in Epio verse, nnnsnltnd
Cornutus ss to the number of books it should be in. Some of his ssutterers told him they
should be four hundred, but Cornutus reid no one would resd οποππ. And when some
οπο οοίο Chrysippus, the Stoio, ποο written msny more, Cornutus suswered οποο his
books hed something useful iu them for humen life. Wherenpon Nero sent him into
exile. This must heve ποοπ efter the death of Persius, οπ. 62. Aooording to ,lemme
it was in 68, οπο lust yser of Nero's reign, [but sooording οο Dion it wss before the
oonsulship of Telesinus, end therefore before no. oo.]

The Sotire turns upon the ebnnoter οπο tesohing of Cornutus. It is supposed to bn
delivered in eonversotiou with him, οπο οπο introduction is well snunged. Persius
begins by referring to οπο oommonplsee of poue ssling the hinse for ο hundred tongues ο
οπο Cornutus eslrs whst πο esu be about, οπο hopes πο is not going to write ο tregedy
or nn Epio poem. lle unswers that he wsuts this gift of tongues to tell his affection
οπο gratitudo towards his friend οπο teueher, whom πο sddresses in effeetiouute lun·

οοποο οποο opportunity to urge upon old οπο young the study of philosophy. One of
the tenete of the Stolos is thet which is dwelt upon οο length in οπο seventh setire of
Hornoe’s second hook, οπο iu the fifth of Cicero's Psrsdoxs, of which οπο title is οτι
μόνος ο cophe ἐλεύθερος sul ucis ἄφρον δοῦλος. Taking up this doctrine Persius occupies
the rest of his Setire with illustretions of it, showing οποο renl liberty is not thnt of
the slave set free by the Praetor, though with his steedom he moy get the world to
