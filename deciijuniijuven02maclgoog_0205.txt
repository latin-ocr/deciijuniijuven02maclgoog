156 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Divitibus responsa dabunt Phryx augur et Indus 000
Conductus, dabit astrorum mundique peritus
Atque aliquis senior qui publica fulgura condit ε
Plebeium in Circo positum 005 05 15 aggere fatum.
Quae nudis longum ostendit cervicibus aurum,
Consulit ante phalas delphinorumque columnas, 590
An saga vendenti nubat caupone relicto.

Hae tamen et partus subeunt discrimen et omnes
Nutricis tolerant fortuna urgente labores:
Sed jacet aurato vix ulla puerpera lecto.
Tantum artes hujus, tantum medicamina possunt, 59⁵
Quae steriles facit atque homines in ventre necandos
Conducit. Gaude, infelix, atque ipse bibendum
Porrige, quidquid erit: nam si distendere vellet
Et vexare uterum pueris salientibus, esses
Aethiopis fortasse pater: mox decolor heres 600
Impleret tabulas, nunquam tibi mane videndus.

Transeo suppositos ct gaudia votaque saepe
