136 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Dic aliquem sodes hic, Quintiliane, colorem. 280
“ Haeremus.” Dio ipsa. “Olim convenerat,” inquit,
“Ut faceres tu quod vellen, nec non ego possem

Indulgere mihi: clames licet et mare caelo

Confundas, homo sum.’' Nihil est audacius illis
Deprensis ; iram atque animos a crimine sumunt. 285
Unde haec monstra tamen vel quo de fonte requiris?

Praestabat castas humilis fortuna Latinas

Quondam, nec vitiis contingi parva sinebat

Tecta labor somnique breves et vellere Tusco

Vexatae duraeque manus ac proximus Urbi 290
Hannibal et stantes Collina turre mariti.

Nunc patimur longae pacis mala ς saevior armis

Luxuria incubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem.
