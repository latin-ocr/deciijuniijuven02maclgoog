INTRODUCTION.

huenen this satire takes general ground, the subject it treats ei is brought honre by
examples aud the mode oi treatment ιο the generation in which it was written. In
this respect aa well as in caustic power, in brilliancy of lauguage, in variety as well aa.
megrana, a n aanor to tus poem aaran n imitation circunmdabant
through which it is best known to the majority ol English readers. 'l'he graphio and
dramatic passage on the fortunas of Sejanus is tamely represented by the corresponding
example of Wolsey; aud the description of charles οι· Sweden is aheavy substitute for
that ol Hannibal. No description of an imbecile old age ever came near that which is
contained iu this satire, and the picturas of Priam's death as it might have been aud aa

’ it was are sceuee which might be mansferred to cauves. 'lhc lauguagc ol N ector at

his son's funeral is 'very mouruthl. 'l'he seriem lines nt the end, though the thoughts
'they coutaiu are not all original, ure in J uvenal's best style, which is better than
Horace’s iu dealing with grave subjecte in serious languege, as it is the style of a man
in sancet, an impressiou which Juvenal always conveys, but Horace seldom. 'lhe
relation ol man to Godis truly stated in the words ‘Carior est illis homo quam sibi ;’
and the rigour of a msuly beart is excellently described iu half a dozen lines, ‘Fortem
posce animum' ac.
'l'hc subject oi the satira is the vaulty ol human wishes, which are seldom conceived
in a reasonable spirit, aud are generally shortsighted aud impuhive‚ ifnot iu themselves
