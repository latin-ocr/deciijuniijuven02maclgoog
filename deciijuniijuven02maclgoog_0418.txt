PROLOGUS.

INTRODUCTION.

Is is generally suppoeed thet Persius, iu publishing his Satires or contemplating their
publication, wrote these few lines asa sort oi Introduction. They have the appearance
of a fragment, and it is not unlilrely he meant ιο write more. By this supposition some
difficulty mising out of the want of connexion will be removed. 'l'he verses arenomore
than an apology for his presumption in presenting his offering ιο the Muses. He ssys
he is consciens that he is no poet, eud he seems to imply that he was driven to write by
’ want, as Horace says he was. But this can only have been meant by Persius for a joke,
and a way of introducing a stroke at the many poete of the dsy who wrote for patrone
and ior what they could get. Some, including Casaubou, Passow, Jahn, ture the verses
as s prologus only tothe first Satine, whichthey suppose is meant by‘carmen nostrnm'
in v. 7. 'l'he title is due to the grammar-iaus, whatever Persius meant

'l'he metre is the cholinmbic or scaren, the trimeter iambic with s spondes in the lest
place, as in Catullns' ode which begine

“0 funde noster, seu Sabine, seu 'Ebura'' (C. 44.)

Ascensus.

I never drank from Hippocrene nor dreamt upon Parnassus, that 1 should be a poet.
The Muses’ haunts 1 leave for those who wear the ivy. 1 am but little better than
a clown, who bring my offering ιο the poets’ store. who taught the pmot and the
pie ιο speak? Hunger, the toacher oi all arts, ableto resch even forbidden tongues.
Iset hope of gain but shine upon them, and you would think cur crows and magpies
’ were singing Muses' nectar. ’
