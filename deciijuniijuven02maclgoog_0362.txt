SA'I'IRA XIV. 313

“ Perfidae, et nigri patietur carceris uncum, 245
Aut maris Aegaei rupem scopulosque frequentes
Exsulibus magnis. Poena gaudebis amara
Nominis invisi, tandemque fatebere laetus
Nec surdum nec Tiresia-m quenquam esse deorum.

SATIRA XIV.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms satire contains corne golden rules and is throughout written in J nvenal's best
style. It exposes one of the radical causes oi the prevailing immorality, which was the
contagione example and bad teaching of parents, acting from their earliest years upon
their children. Inavicious home nothing bntvice can be learnt: tha sin of the father
is visited upon the son because the son contracte and exaggerates the father’s vices: the
gemester begets gementem ς the licentious begct profligates; the apendthriit is the
father oi spendthrists and the miser of misera 5 partly from the force of infection and
partly baanae tecching cannot as a general rule riso above practice, and he who paradas
his faults before his child cannot even reprove that child if he adopts them. There is
not a moro pregnant sentence in any author than that, “Maxima debetur pneris
reverentia? It is a truth which the better instincta of mankind at once acknowledge,
and it could not have been better expressed or supported in mors dignified language
than Juvenal has here used. It would have been pleasant if his experienca or the scope
οἰ his satire had admitted of his drawing a picture of a home in which virtue grows
by the same means as vice grows by in others, and showing ns how domestic example
and the influence ol a happy home act on the characters of men and the well-being of ·
society.

The inherited vices J uvenal speaks of are gaming, luxurians living, violence of temper,
contempt forinferiors, sensuality, extravagance, superstition, and avarice. The greater
partos the satire is taken up with the last, and the love of getting, for the sake of
having or for· display, is traced from its earliest impression on the young mind, to which
in general itis not natural, through injustice, selfishness, crime, and danger, to the
miserable auxiety that waits upon possession after all has been done to secure it. Once
only he touches shortly on the influence of mothers' example on their daughters. There
isas might bs expecteda reference to the simplicity of the oldentime, and there are one
or two picturas, as of the anxious host (v. 59, sqq.) and the soldier’s family (166, sqq.)
such as Juvenal sketches with peculiar power.

ARGUMENT.

There's many an act of foul report, Fuscinas, leaving its stain for ever on young minds,
which parents teach their children both by precept and example. The old man
games, his boy too shnkes the dice. What hope is there of him who learns in youth
tc season fig-pechers and mnshrooms, taught by his father? Give him a thon-
