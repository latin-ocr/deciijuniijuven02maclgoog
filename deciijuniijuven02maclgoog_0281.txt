231 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Clausit et egregias Lateranorum obsidet aedes
'Pota cohors: rarus venit in coenacula miles.
Pauca licet portes argenti vascula puri,
Nocte iter ingressus gladium contumque timebis
Et motae ad lunam trepidabis arundinis umbram :
Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.
Prima fere vota et cunctis notissima templis
Divitiae, crescant ut opes, ut maxima toto
Nostra sit arca foro. Sed nulla aconita bibuntur 25
Fictilibus: tunc illa time, quum pocula sumes
Gemmata et lato Setinum ardebit in auro.
