SATIRA XI. 259

your pnrse will go no further than a gudgeon. What cun you come to if your appe·
tite grows lurger as your purse grows emptier ς when all you have is buried in your
bellyi’ The ring goes lest, and Pollio with bare finger begs. Wantonness feam not
early death, but age much worse than death. The steps are these. Money is bor·
rowed first and spent at Rome ς but when the usnrer begins to trouble them, then
off they go to some nice country town. To run away from the forum is no worse
than from-Suburra ιο migrate ιο Esquiliae: they only care that they must lose the
gemes: they never thinkol blushing: Modesty is laughed et as she dies the town,
and few men care to stay her. ’

V. 56. Today, my friend, you’ll see whether I practise what lpreach, or praise plain
sare but call sor rich. You'll find in me Evander, you shall be Hercules or Aeneas.
Now listen to your dinner. A young lid from my farm, and wild roots guthered by
my gardener's wit'e ; fresh eggs warm in the nest, and bens that laid them; grspes
fresh as when first pluolred, the duest pears and apples, the crude juice dried from
out them.

V. 77. Such was the dinner of our senators when first they grew luxurious. The herbe
he gethered in his little garden, such aa a ditcher now turns up his nose et, Curius
would boil with his own hand. The ditch hung up to dry in former times they kept
for holidays‚ and lard for birthdays for their blood relatione end part of the victim’s
meat. The grem man who had thrice been consul, dictator too, went to such fessts
stallring along with spade upon his shoulder. In the strict Censor's days no one
would ask what sort of turtles might -be found in the sea, ιο ornament the rich man's
conch: they were content with a rude ass's head. Their foed and house and furni·

Ι ture were plain alike.

V. 100. Unslrilled in art, the cups they got for plunder the soldiers broke ιο ornament
their harnes· or their helmets· The only silver that they had adorned their arms.
Their hemely fare was serued in earthenware. If you’re inclined ιο envy, you might
envy those good times. 'lhe gods were ncarer nnto meu3 they warned the city of
thc Gauls’ approach, such care for Rome had Jupiter when made cf clay. The tables

' then were made oi home-grown wood. But now the richest viando have no flavour
except on a round table with acarved ivory etem3 a silver one to them is rude as au
iron ring upon the finger.

V. 129. l’ll have no guest then who despises povcrty. I have not an ounce of ivory in
all my house 3 the very handles oi my knives are boue; and yet they do not spoil the '
meat, or cut the worse for that. And I've no carver taught by first-rate artist, who
tsaches them to cut up all dne dishes. My man's a norice too, and cannot dlch
except in a sinall way, a chop or so. I’ve only s rough boy in woolleu clothes ιο
offer you my vulgar herbe, no eastern bought for avast price from dealers. Whutever
you may ask for ask in Latin. They all οπο dressed alilre, their hair cropped straight,
combed out to·dsy in honour of my guest ς boys from 'the farm, modest as those
should be who wear the purple, not trained to lewdness. . One shall bring yon wine
grown on his native hills. Loolr not for wunton dunning girls (such as your married
ladies gaze ut with their husbands at their elbow) to ticlrlc lustr though women care sor
this more than the men. But this is not for humble houses. We leave the click of
castaneta sud songs too lcwd for brothels and all the triclrs of lust for those who void
their rheam on msrble floors. We make allowances for wealth, only the poor are
ehamed by gambling and adultery: the rich who do such things ure merry gentle·
men. You'll flnd with me a different sort of sporta: we’ll read what Homer wrote

’ and his peer Mero. It matters not what voice recites such verses.

V. 1⁸3. But come, put care away and tale a rest. We’ll have no word ot debts or s
jealcus thoughts ς before my door you must put off all this, home and its troubles,
alares and their breahages, and worse than all the ingratitudo of friends. The grem
