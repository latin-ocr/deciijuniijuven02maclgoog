considered the best. I have not made the collation myself, but I have
examined it and I· hope it is sufficient. This collation does not show
the differences in orthography‚ where the words are the same, nor the
differences in punctuation except in some cases where these differendas
effect the sense. I have examined all the passages in which these two
texts differ, and I find a great many in which Macleane's text is better
than thet of Jahn, who has introduced some bad readings. Ihave
observed a few passages in which Ι should prefer Jahn's text, but on
the whole I think the Englishman has shown more good sense and
judgment than the German.

Ι have added in the notes nearly all the variatione of Ribbeck's text.
Many of Ribbeck’s variatione are the same as Jahn’s, but he has some of
his own, and most of them seem to me bad. Some of his transpositione
· improve the text, but most of them do not. He has handled the sixth
Satine so freely as to the transposition and omission of verses, thet
it would require much time and study to pass a just judgment on his
labour; but it will be generally allowed thet the matter of this Satira,
as it stands in the commentans, is not well arranged.

Ihave made many small corrections in Mr. Macleane’s notes, where
there was some slight error or mis-statement, but I have omitted nothing
and altered nothing which Ι believe the editor would not have omitted
or corrected. He would probably have changed his opinion on some
points, and would both have omitted and altered much more than I have
done, for my business was not to edit Juvenal and Persius, but to pre-
serve the work of my friend. The references in ,this volume are very
numerous, and the canses of errors in the figures of such references ere
various. Ι have corrected a great many wrong references, and though
I cannot hope that Ι have corrected all, I believe that the errors which
remain are not many. In the references to the MSS. Ι have discovered
a few slight errors since this book was printed, but they are not such as
to require any particular notice. Ι have added a little in the notes here
and there, where I thought it necessary. All the additions which
I have made are marked thus [ ].

Ribbeck haspublishedanessayonduvenal(“DerEchteundderUneohte
Juvenal, Berlin,'' 1865), which ie to some extent a justification of his
text. After briefly stating how much we learn from Juvenal of Roman
manners from the time of Tiberius to Trajan and Hadrian, he adds that
this knowledge is got exclusively from the first nine Satires and the
eleventh; that the tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
supply scarcely any information of the kind. They contain mere allu-
sione to well-known names and persone, or introduce characters of
various kinds, which are not marked by any individuality. The genuine
Juvenal is a follower of Lucilius, and though ha did not lash his cone
