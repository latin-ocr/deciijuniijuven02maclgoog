D.'JUN11 JUVENALIS

Ergo hic praecipuum summumque meretur honorem,
Qui grege linigero circumdatus et grege calvo
Plangentis populi currit derisor Anubis.
Ille petit veniam, quoties non abstinet uxor ⁵³5
Concubitu saeris observandisque diebus,
Magnaque debetur violato poena cadurco,
Et movisse caput visa est argentea serpens:
Illius lacrimae meditataque murmura praestant
Ut veniam culpae non abnuat ansere magno 540
Scilicet et tenui popano corruptus Osiris.

Quum dedit ille locum, cophino foenoque relicto
Arcenam J udaea tremens mendicat in aurem,
Interpres legum Solymarum et magna sacerdos
Arboris ae summi fida internuntia caeli; 545
Implet et illa manum, sed parcius: aere minuto
Qualiscunque voles J udaei somnia vendunt.

Spondet amatorem tenerum vel divitis orbi
Testamentum ingens calidae pulmone columbae
