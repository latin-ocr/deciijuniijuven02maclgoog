SA'PIRA II. 398

Emeris auriculas? pulmone et lactibus unctis? ³0
Ecce avia, aut metuens divum matertera, cunis
Exemit puerum, frontemque atque uda labella
Infami digito et lustralibus ante salivis
Rapiat, urentes oculos inhibere perita.
ltine manibus quatit, et spem macram supplice voto 35
Nunc Licini in campos, nunc Crassi mittit in aedes.
‘Hunc optent generum rex et regina ; puellae
Hunc rapiant 3 quicquid calcaverit hic rosa fiat !'
Ast ego nutrici non mando vota; negato,
Jupiter, haec illi, quamvis te albata rogarit. 40
Poscis opem nervis corpusque fidele senectae.
Esto age: sed grandes patinae tucetaque crassa
Annuere his superos vetuere J ovemque morantur.
Rem struere exoptas caeso bove, Mercuriumque
