ulau 01⁴¹ JUVENAL. xvii

aw'ay, for it was written shortly after the consulship of Junius, and
therefore, if Sabinus be theman, in the middle or towards the beginning
of Domitian’s reign. But it will be shown below that the banishmnt
could not have happened till late iu Domitian’s reign, and I believe
Hadrian's consul, iunius Rusticus, is meant, and that the Satira was
written early in Hadrian’s reign, that is about an. 121, or two years
after the consulship of J unius ⁸.

In Sat. 11111. 17 16 speaks of Calvinus, the friend he addresses, as
then sixty years old, and born in the consulship of Fonteius. I think
it almost certain that the consul referred to is L. Fonteius Capito, cos.
aa). 59, and that therefore the Satira was written towards the bes
ginning 61 Hadrian’s reign, and not earlier than 111). 119.

2 ¹The earlier date to which Lipsius and others 16161 11, as stated in my ’
note (xiii. 17), is forty-seven¹ years before the reign 61 Hadrian. .
Either, therefore, Juvenal did not write at all in that reign, or this
Satire was written while Hadrian was emperor, about aa). 119.
Otherwise Juvenal’s Satires must range over a period 61 fifty years or
thereabouts, and one of the very 1661 must have been nearly the earliest.
These who are of opinion that the allusion 16 Meroe in v. 163 of this
satire, resulted from personal observation, must be prepared to admit
the later date, or to suppose that the banishment of Juvenal to Egypt
by Domitian is altogether fabulous, and that his visit to that country
must have 16611 early in the reign of Vespasian, if not before it, since
the Satira, according to the other hypothesis, must have been written
about the fourth year of that reign, and nine years before Domitian
became emperor.

Thus the sixth, seventh, thirteenth, and fifteenth Satires have internal
evidences by which they may be referred to the reign of Hadrian, and
61 these the three last, I have no doubt, were written under that·
emperor. · ,

But if we 1611611). 120 66 116 1616611616 61 which there is evidence,
how far back may we go to determine the author’s age?

It is nearly certain that the first Satira was written in Trajan’s reign,
1161 long after the banishment of Marius Priscus, aa). 100.

The reference to war 011 the Euphrates in the eighth Satire (v. 51)

makes it probable that the poem was written during the Armenian and
Parthian wars (1.1). 114-116), ,in the course 61 which (1.1). 115)

⁸ Ruperti, I think, is right in saying “Satira xv. hoc forte auno scripta (1111166
superiore, nam si tam recens factum esset quod in 66 narrat, poeta opinor v. 27 simpli·
citer dixisset ‘nupeu’ neque adjecisset ‘Consule J unio ’ '’ (Vita J uv. per annos digesta,
vol. i. p. xxx). 'l'his commentator thinks that Juvenal, uow in his eighty-first year, was
suspected of having written Satira vii against Hadrian, and was banished by him.
Poor old man!
