He reverenced as 0 father Servilius Nonianus. Through Cornutus he
made the acquaintance 01 Annaeus Lucanus likewise⁶, who was 01 his
own age and 0 disciple 01 Cornutus. Now Cornutus was a tragic writer
01 that day ¹, 01 11ιο 81010 0001, 0οᾶ 1ιο 1011 behind him books 01 philo·
sophy. Lucanus so admired the writings 01 Flaccus, that while he was
reciting he could scarcely refraiu from crying out [and saying that this
was true poet1y]⁸. He became acquaiuted with 8000000100,101010
1110, but not so as to be taken by his character. He enjoyed in Cornu·
tus' house the society 01 two most learned men 01 very holy lives, at
thettime eamestly engaged in philosophy, namely, Claudius Agathe·
merus, a physician 01 Lacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates 01
Magnesia, whom above all others he admired and emulated, for they
were his contemporaries aud disciples 01 Cornutus ⁹. He was also -for
nearly ten years greatly beloved by Paetus Thrasea, and travelled
with him sometimes, Thrasea having married Persius’ kinswoman Arria.
He was a man 01 most gentle monuere, 01 maidenly modesty, 01100001-
some form, and 0 pattem 01 piety towards his mother, and sister, and
aunt. He was· disoreet and chaste. He left about two million
sesterces to his mother aud sister, aud only wrote 0 0010 10 his mother,
asking her 10 give Cornutus a hundred thousand sesterces, as some say,
but as others will have it, twenty pounds’ weight 01 wrought silver, aud
about seven hundred volumes 01 Chrysippus, or all his libra1y¹. But
Cornutus took the books and 1011 the money sor his mother and sister,
whom'he had made his heirs ¹. He wrote seldom and slowly. This
very book he 1011 unfinished. Some verses have been taken from the
end 0111ιο book, that it might seem finished. Cornutus made some
trifling corrections3 aud when Caesius Bassus asked that he might him·
0011 bs allowed to edit it, he gave it him for that purpose. Flaccus also
in his boyhcod had written a comedy called Restio ³, and one book 01

as Cornutus himself was. ι

contradicts what has just been said. ‘Frater' was added when the harmiscare, ‘sorori-
