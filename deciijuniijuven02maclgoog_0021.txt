xvi INTRODUCTION.

Hadrian succeeded Trajan in an. 117, ami there is an allusion to the
silence 011110 01001001 Delphi in vi. 555, which makes it appear that the
Satira was written before the reign of Hadrian, or at 110001001000001001,
101 he restored that oracle which Nero had stopped. This probably
took place during Hadrian's residence at Athens, an. 123-126.

It 10 001 0011010 10 what years 01 his reign Hadrian erected the mag·
nificent palace near Tibur, of which the ruins still exist 3 probably not
before an. 134. But it 10 001101011 was not built when Juvenal wrote
his fourteenth Satira, or he would have referred 10111 among the build-
ings he names 11. 86-91.

Βο1 the seventh Satire, which has been the subject 01 00 much disputa,
appears to me to bear the strongest internal evidence of having been

’ written 1n Hadrian's reign. He was an author himself, and the petron ἵ

01 authors, and Juvenal could not have said this 01 any 01 the 011101
emperors that preceded him without egregious flattery, of which he was
incapable. The statement 01 the Scholiast that in that Satire “Nero-
nem palpat '' is not worthy of notice.

The fifteenth Satirc turns upon an event said to have happened
“nuper Consule 50010 ” (v. 27) ἓ. It may not be possible to say with

’ certainty which consul 500100 he refers 10. But my own opinion, and

that 01 many others, is, that it was 500100 Rusticus who was consul in
a, n 119, the second year of Hadrian's reign. I cannot doubt 11101111
this 8011110 5 0101101 101010 10 his 010011ρο11οηοο of Egypt during 0 resi-
dence there' 10 10111101 years Heinrich's pupil, Francke, has taken ³
great paine to show that Juvenal had never been' m Egypt But 11010
obliged 10 get rid of so many 101000 00 spurious which I believe 10 be as
genuine as any in the Satira, that his arguments are of no velue in my
opinion. It is possible 50101101 may have been in Egypt before 1.]1. 84,
when 1110 only other 500100, Appius 5011100 80111000, was consul, 11101
being the third year of Domitian's reign. In that case the whole story
011110 exile by Domitian becomes a fable, as the details 01 11 manifestly
are, unless it be said that the 801110 was written in Egypt, or, if written
at Rome, that the poet had been recalled by the emperor who sent him

¹ Jahn and G. 1⁴¹. Hermann, in their editions, have adopted the variant 50000 101
501110, from Pithoeus’ MS. Hermann, in his Dissertation on the seventh Satira
(thtingen, 1843), 101100 Junius Rusticus for the consul, but in the prefaoa to his
edition (1854) he argues 101· 5011000, who, he says, was Consul emacularet. I
adhcre 10 500100 3 but Hermann’s date, which 10 eight years later, would not materially
affect the view 1 taho 01 the poet's 001001. Juncus does not appear in the Fasti till
