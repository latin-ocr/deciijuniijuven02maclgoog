SATIRA ΙΙΙ. 43

and tells his reasons for leaving bis native place. No honest man can thrive there, he
says3 the town is overrun with cunning foreigners and upstarts who have trickedthem-
selvas into riches and influence, making themselves necessary to familias and getting their
masters' secrete. The poor too hav'e no chance, and poverty apes wealth ; every thing

. has to be bought, and every thing is deor. There are fres and falling houses, and even

these are only ruinous ιο the poor: the rich helpone another, while the poor manstarves.
The noises at night are such that no one can sleep, at least no poor man in the lodging-
houses. The rich man rides safely through the streete, while the poor is elbowed hythe
crowd, and has a good chance of being killed hy great beanrs and stones, or by pots froin
the uppers tories, andscfmth, or by some drnnken branler who plcks aquarrel with him
or by robbers who break into his house st· night.

There are some parts of the satire which remind the reader of Horace's style, parti·
cularly the quaint description of a poor man 'senoonnter with a drunken bully who, after
beating his victim savagely, summons him for an assault.

Umbricius rs any body There was an ‘'haruspex of tha tname, of whom Tacit tus relatas
thot he warned Galba of his fate. But there rs no sense in supposing him to be the man
lt was a common name. Thet sat ire may have been written about the same time as the
last ,- but it is impossible ιο say.

ARGUMENT.

'Ihough Iam in despair at the loss of an old friend, [cannot but commend Um-
bricius’ resolution to quit the town and go away to the pleasant shores of Cumae.
There' rs no wilderness I would not myself prefer tot the dangers end annoyances of
this city.

V. 10. While his family and gocds were all being packed into one cart, we stopped' ιιι

. the valley of Aegeria, whose wood' rs let to beggarly Jews, and her native fonntain
disligured by art. And thus my friend began:

V. 21. “ No room is here forvirtue, no return forhonest labour ; andasIam getting poorer
every day, I mean to take myself to Cumae while 1 have any vigour leth. 1 bid my
native place farewell; let regnes live there, and by their dirty trades get rich; till
trumpeters shall rise to give the shows they once proclaimed, and get monopolies of
every thing, raised high by fortune in her merry moods. What can Ido et Rome? not
lie, or praise poor books, or tell the stars, or search the insides of frogs. Ι am no pimp
or thies. So all avoid me as a useless limb. 'None but accomplices are petronized,
with horrid secrete burning in their bosoms. The thief loves him who can accuse
him when he pleases. No gold will pay you for the wretched nights it eosts you to
be feared of your great friend.

V. 58. ‘⁴ The town is overrun with Greeks; and worse, Syria has poured her refuse into
Rome—her language, customs, harpe, and drums, and harlots. Away all ye who love
the turbaned strumpetsl Thy hardy sons, Quirinus, put on Greek shoes, and grease
their necks for the ‘palaestra' From every town they swarm and creep into rich
heusen-elever, abandoned, impudent, prompt, fluent. What should yon say that man
was? Any thing yon plesse, all arts and seienees he knows5 the stanveling Greek
will put on wings if you bid him-for Daedalus was a Greek, and born at Athens.

V. 81. “ What, must I not avoid their purple i shall that men rank before me who came
to ns with the plums and figsf Have Ι ιιοι breathed from infancy the air of Rome,
and is that nothing? These flatterers by trade know how to gain belief when they

praise a blockhead’s talents, and a plain man’s face, long neck, and squeaking voice.
lf I should praise them, no one would believe me. Their acting isquite perfect 3 their
whole tribe are players. Yon laugh, they laugh still louder ,· you weep, they weep but
grieve not 3 call for a fine, they’ll get their cloak; say you it’s hot, they sweat. So
