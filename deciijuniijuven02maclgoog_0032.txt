111101 PERSIUS. xxvii

Annaeus Cornutus,a philosopher 61 the Stoic school, to which most
men 61 thought at that time belonged. To Cornutus he became much
attached, and the 11161161166611161611611661161 116 life. His obli·
gations to this excellent manha feehngly achnowledges in the fifth
Satira. While he was at school 'he appeans to have written a comedy;
also a poem, probably of a humorous cast, which he called Ὀδοιπορικά,
Wayside Verres, 61 Τ16 Traveller, or whatever it may have been, and
some verses on the death 61 his kinewoman Arria. She was the wife of
Caecina Paetus, who for treason was put 16 death by Claudius. The
allusion in the life is to her 66611161 61 this occasion. Paetus was
required to be his own executioner. His wife, who loved him devotedly
and had declared 616 would die with him, took a dngger, stabbed herself,
drew it out, and handed it 16 161 husband, and said, ⁶⁴ Paetus, itis not
poinful ⁶.’' This happened 111. 42, before Persius was eight years old.
These early productione his motharkept till her death, and 111611, by the
judicious advice 61 Cornutus, destroyed them. '
How soon after his father’s death his mother married again, it 'is im-
possible to say. But that she 1611161161 with her two children, Aulus
and his sister, at Volaterrae, till the boy was old enough to go to Rome,
aud that she continued to superintend his educatien till 16 went to
Cornutus, may be assumed 'The Scholiast, on S. vi. 6, says that after '
the death of her first husband she married in Liguria, where Persius was
staying when that Satine was written. It is more likely that she retired
to this part 61 116 country, toa house left her by 1161 second husband,
after his death, leaving her 661 16 pursue his studies under the guidanoe
and roof 61 Cornutus ⁶. '
’ Α1 1116 time he formed an intimate acquaintance with that Caesius
Bassus to whom the last Satine is addmsssd, 'and with Calpurnius Sura,
61 whom however we know nothing 111616 1161 116 Grammarian tells us,
that he died young, aud that Persius survived blm.

⁵ See Pliny, Epp. iii. 16. Μ611161 (1. 11) hasen epigram 611 thir event:

“ Casta suo gladium cnm traderet Arria Paeto,
Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis,
‘Si qua fides wrlnus qnod 1661 161 16161,’ inquit,
‘Sed quod tu facies hoc mihi, Paete, dolet.''’

⁶ From Persius' way 61 speaking 61 Lunae Portus it has been supposed by some that
16 was born thore. But independently 61116 express testimony 61 116 Grammarian, ’
there is presumptive evidence in the name 61 Sisennia, which is Etmrian, and in Arria
his lrinswoman having married'Caeoina, whose family were natives 61 Volaterrae, to con·
firm the statement that Persius was born there. There isof course 116 weight to be
6116616116 116 tradition which is mentioned only, as far as I know, in Bayls’s notice of
Persius in his Dictionary‚ that a medem family 61 Volterra (the Palconcini) are derived
116111 Persins’ father, who had but one son, and he died 1111611161. From the 66116
666166 I learn thatahonse was shown ocantury ago at Volterra as that 61 Persius.
