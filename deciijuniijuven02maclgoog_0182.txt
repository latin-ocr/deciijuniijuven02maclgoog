SATIRA VI. 133

Atque alios mores quarn quos habet: utile porro 240
Filiolam turpi vetulae producere turpem.

Nulla fere eausa est in qua non femina litem
Moverit. Accusat Manilia si rea non est.

Componunt ipsae per se formantque libellos,

Principium atque locos Celso dictare paratae. 245

Pectore plus agitat veraeque paratur arenae.

Quale decus rerum si conjugis auctio fiat, 255
