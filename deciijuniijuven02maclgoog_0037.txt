been supposed to represent the handsome features attributed to Persius,
but they may be any body, and we must be content with the Gram- ¹
marian’s testimony to his heauty.

Tun publishers of this edition of Juvenal and Persius, having deter-
mined to reprint the book, asked me to correct the sheets. Though very
busy about other things, Icould not refusa to perform this slight service ,
for the work of my departed friend. It is to me a cause of great regret ¹
that Mr. Maoleane did not live to revise this volume. His tastes and
his ahilities particularly qualified him to be an editor ofJuvenal and
Persius; and as a first edition of such a book must be imperfect, he
would certainly have improved it, if he had lived long enough. His
knowledge of the world, his strong sense, quick perception, and souml ’
judgment, applied to a second edition, might have produced a work that
would have satisfied the readers cf Juvenal and Persius for some time.
What he has done however is well worth preserving, and I believe that
future editors-and indue time they will appear,-may find in the Intro·
ductions,A1·guments, and Notos, much matter that will help them towards
the meaning of the Satirists. Ido not think that Mr. Maoleane has
often missod the sense of his authors, and he has certainly sei'zed
it sometimes where other editors have not. Hc possessed one quality in
a striking degree-a bold and independent judgment, without which an
editoris in danger of being confused and misled by a great variety of
opinions. His notes show the character of his mind. He often ex*
presses his opinion very positively, and sometimes perhaps in a way that
‚may offend; but he had a sincerc‘respect for good sense and sound
knowledge in others3 he had none of the feeble conceit which often gostv
with what is termed learning, and ho had some reason to feel confidenct
in his own judgment, for few men were so quick in detecting au
absurdity or went so straight to the meaning of a thing. The intro·
duction to the thirteeuth Satira of Juvenal is an evidence of his large
and liberal views on a subject on which many who belong to his profes·
sion, and even others who-do not, have uttered ond ‚still uttcr their
wretched commonplaces. Ι

Ι have not altered the text of this edition, and in only a few
places the punctuation. Ihave added a collation of this text ol'
Juvenal with that of Jahn, whose useful edition is now generally
