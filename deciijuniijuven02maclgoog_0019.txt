xiv INTRODUCTION.

great crowds, and with great success, several times : so that he was led
to insert in his first writings those verses which he had written first :

‘Quod non dant proceres dabit histrio: tu Camerinos
Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas?
Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos ².’

The player was at that 1111166116 of the favourites at court, and many of
his supportem were daily promoted. Juvenal, therefore, fell under
suspicion as one who had covertly censured the times; and forthwith
under colour of military promotion, though. 116 was eighty years of age,
he was removed from the city, and sent to be praefectus of a eohort
which was stationed in the farthest part of Egypt. That sort of
punishment was determined upon as being suited to a light and joculsr
offenoe. Within a very short time he died of vexation and disgust.”

The chief points stated in the foregoing life are, that Juvenal was the
son of a rich freedman'either by birth or by adoption (for this I suppose
1116 writer means); that he was a practised rhetorieian; 'that 116 began
to write satire after middle life; that his first attempt was an epigram
upon Paris the pantomimus⁸3 that he was encouraged by the success of
this production to write Satires on a larger scale, which at first he
concealed, but afterwards read them to large audiences with great
applause 3 that whereas 116 was rash enough to introduce in one of his
poems the original epigram (which, as I suppose the writer means 16
imply, so became more Publio, and probably for the first time reached
the ears of the person it was aimed at), Paris by his influente at
court obtained his banishment‚ under the honourable form of a military
command, 161116 farthest part of Egypt 3 that he was then eighty years
of age ⁴, and that he shortly died of vexatipn.

Another of these notices states that Juvenal was born at Aquinum,
in 1116 reign of Claudius; that 116 returned from exile, survived the
reign of Trajan, and finally died of old age in a fit of coughing.

In a third we are told that when he returned to Rome, finding his
friend Martial was dead, he died of grief in his eighty-second year.

A fourth says it was Domitian who exiled him; that 116 never re·
nuned, but that aiter correcting and adding 16 his Satires in Egypt, 116
died there of old age in 1116 reign of Antoninus Pius.

Fr0m a fifth we learn that he was advanced 16 the equestrian rank
through his own merit3 that the plaoe of his honourable exile was
Scotland, and that the motiva was that he might be killed in battle ;

² S. vii. 90, sqq.

³ 'fhough there were two players of this name, one a favoarite of Nero, the other of
Domitian, there can 116 116 doubt the writer means Domitian's man.

⁴ As Paris was put to death an. 88, this would make Juvenal to have been born
about 1116 year 6116 of the Christian 616 (1187, 11616).
