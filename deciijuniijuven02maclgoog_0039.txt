xxxiv v INTRODUC'PION.

temporarias, the personages on whom he pours out hie indignation are
those with whom he and his contemporaries were well acquainted, and
they are those of whom mention is made by Tacitus, Suetonius, the
younger Pliny, and Martial. In 1110 spurious Satires, on the contrary,
which are the work cf a Declamator, as Ribbeck calls him, the few
names which may belong to contemporaries of Juvenal are with some
exceptione totally unknown. ¹ These Satires also give us little informa-
tion on manners or events in Rome, while nearly every line of the
genuine Satires contains instructive matter. The Declamator abounds
in allusione to Greek and Roman history and to mythical legende.
Even Moses 10 introduced tous. 11 is true that the writer of the
genuine Satires shows that he was well acquainted with Greek and
Roman history; but he''handles his matter like a man of sense, who
knows the world, while the Declamator writes like a pedant.

Α The Declamator, who tells us little about Rome, treats us with a great
deal about foreign parts, and in the fifteenth Satira he even takes us
into Egypt3 and yet, as Ribbeck maintains, he does not even know that
Canopus (xv. 44, and the note) is in Egypt.

It has been observedalso, he adds, that 1110 Declamator has a turn for
philosophy, but the genuine Juvenal scarcely indicates any teste for such
speculation. He never uses the word Sapientia, which the Declamator
' prizes highly, and, following the Stoic doctrine, declares that Nature and
Philosophy teach the something (xiii. 189). He seems also to have
collected some of his philosophical matter 'from other writers3 for
instance, Sat. x. 28, 810, greatly resembles a passage 111 Seneca De
Tranquillitate Animi, 0. 15, ‘Democritum potius ;' and the matter of a
passage in Sat. 11. 346 may have been derived from Valerius Maximus,
vii. 2, Ext. l (see 1110 note on that passage).

From this brief statement the reader may collect the nature of the
general objections to the genuineness of the five Satires which Ribbeck
attributes to an unknown Declamator. He supporta his general 0011·
01110100 by an examinatior of many passages, and he employa a chapter
of three-and-seventy well filled pages in belabou'ring the unfortunate
Declamator, to whom, as far as I have observed, he allows no merit at
all, not even to 1110 few lines which may be admired by those who do
1101 value all the Declamator’s poetry. These who will take the paine
to read Ribbeok’s satirical remarks on the false Satirist‚ will be amused
and instructed, if they shall not be convinced. In fact he has under-
taken 10 prove what 10 often difficult 10 prove, and sometimes impossible;

that some are genuine and some are not. But he evidently has confi-
dence 111 his own conclusion, and he presses it so hard that he sometimes
