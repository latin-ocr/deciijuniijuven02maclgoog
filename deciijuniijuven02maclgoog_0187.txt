138 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

I nunc et dubita qna sorbeat aera sanna

Tullia, quid dicat notae eollactia Maurae,

Maura Pudicitiae veterem quum praeterit aram.

Noctibus hic ponunt lecticas, micturiunt hic,

Effigiemque Deae longis siphonibus implent, ³10
Inque vices equitant ac Luna teste moventur.

Inde domos abeunt: tu calcas luce reversa

Conjugis urinam magnos visurus amieos.

Nota Bonae secreta Deae, quum tibia lumbos

Incitat et cornu pariter vinoque feruntur 315
Attonitae crinemque rotant ululantque Priapum

Concubitus! quae vox saltante libidine! quantus

Ille meri veteris per crura madentia torrens!

Lenonum ancillas posita Saufeia corona

Provocat et tollit pendentis praemia coxae :

Ipsa Medullinae fluctum crissantis adorat.

Palmam inter dominas virtus natalibus aequat.

Nil ibi per ludum simulabitur: omnia fient ,
