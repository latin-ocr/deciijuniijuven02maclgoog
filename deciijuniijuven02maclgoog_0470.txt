In Venerem est putris: sed cum lapidosa cheragra
Fregerit articulos veteris ramalia fagi, '
'lunc crassos transisse dies lucemque palustrem σο
Et sibi jam seri vitam ingemuere relictam.
At te nocturnis juvat impallescere chartis,
Cultor enim juvenum purgatas inseris aures

Vertentem sese, frustra sectabere canthum,
Cum rota posterior curras et in axe secundo.
