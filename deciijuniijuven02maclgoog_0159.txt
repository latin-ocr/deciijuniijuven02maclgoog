110 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

from long peace: luxury broods orer us, more pestilent than arms, to arengo tlre
conquered world. Lust has been rampant ever since the poverty ol Rome departed;
’twas this brought Greece amongst us. ’Twns money gave us foreign habits, and
broke down the nge with seli-indulgence. For what care lust and drunkenncss
combined? See how the wantons sneer at modesty, and shame her very altars.
We all know the good goddess’ secret rites3 how her mad votaries, drunk with wine
and music, rare, whirl their looks, and call upon Priapus. No acting then, but

⁴ wantouness et which the blood of age might warm again. They call for meu-und
would that sacred rites were free from wickedness like this-but every one has heard
of him who in old deys stole in where all tlrat’s male must hide its head: then who
dared pour contempt on sacred things? Now we'vo a Clodius lor every altar.

V. 316. “ Theo put a lock upon the women.'' dyo, but who shall watch the watchers?
They are the first to fall. Highest and lowest, she who trnmps the streete und she
who rides in litters, all are frail.

V. ³52. 'Posce the gamos Ogulnia hircs her clothes and every thing, sor ull her fortune’s
gone to smoothcheeked athletes. They're poor, bnt have uo care for that; and
sqaander what a thrifty husband sares, and think that money grows like trees. 'lhey
never think how much thcir pleasures eost.

V. 379. Suppose she’s fond of music, there's no singer but she corrupte him; her
favourlto's harp is always in her hund: she kisses it, end thinks 'tis him she holds iu
her embraoe. Some noble dame, they say, with meal and uu'ne aaked all the gods
whether hor Pollio’s harp might hope to win the prize. What more could she 11 ber

husband or her children were adying? What, Jauus, dost thou unswer such y

inquiries? Ye have not much to do then in the skies.
V. ³98. But let her bc s siuger rather than a masculine bold gossip, who talks among
the officere, knows all the news, public and private, waits at the gates to pick up the

first tidings from abroad, and then distributes lies concerning floods, and earthquakes e

and so forth ιο every woman that she meets in the town.

V. 412. But she‘s more beerable than savage women who dog their poorer neighbours,
aud il a dog burks fly intoa rege, and beat the heast and his owner. She goes at
night to tho both, keeps her gnests waiting for their dinner, then comes home hosted
and thirsty‚ drinks off two piuts and vomita them again to get an appetita 'l'hc
husband veils his eyes from the siekening sight.

V. 434. But she is worse who when she goes to dinner begins lorthwith commending
Virgil, comparing him with Homer. 'l’he learned hold their tongues, even the women
theirs, while she clacks on like bells or basius when they're struck. No one need help
the moon with trumpet or with cymbals; she can deliver her without your aid. Your
learned woman ought ιο wear short tunica, sacrifice ιο Silvanus, go and bathe with the
men. Many no woman who cantnlk, and argue, and knows all knowledge. Ihate
your woman rhetorician who speaks by rule, and recollects old verses Ι never heard ol,

and sorrecis the barbarismo ol her friends. Pray let a husband make mistakes some·

[255. But most unbearable ol ull is she who dccks herself abroad with jewels3 at

she cercior looking wellet home? For puramours she bnys her nard and all the
perfirmss of the uest, soltens her skin with asses' milk, and takes the covering off that
hides her beauty. A thing made up with drugs und poultices, what call ye it, a face
or sore?

V. 474. What do they do by day? 11 they get up eroes, woe to the poor waiting-girl,
the tolletis-men ore stripped, the Liburniun surarts, one with lhe horrible scourge,
the other with the whip. Some keep the executionem in see. And while the lash
goes oa she’s dressing, talking wilh her lrieuds, looking at her gown, or reading ber
