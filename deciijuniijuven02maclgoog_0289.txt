240. D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Et nimias poscebat opes, numerosa parabat
Excelsae turris tabulata, unde altior esset
Casus et impulsae praeceps immane ruinae.
Quid Crassos, quid Pompeios evertit, et illum
Ad sua qui domitos deduxit flagra Quirites?
Summus nempe locus nulla non arte petitus, 110
Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis.
Ad generum Cereris sine caede et'vulnere pauci
Descendunt reges et sicca morte tyranni.
Eloquium ac lhmam Demosthenis aut Ciceronis
, Incipit 'optare et totis Quinquatribus optet, 115
Quisquis adhuc uno partam colit asse Minervam,
Quem sequitur custos angustae vernula capsae.
