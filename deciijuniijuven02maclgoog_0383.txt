334 D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Et qui per fraudes patrimonia conduplicare,
Dat libertatem et totas effundit habenas
Curriculoy quem si revoces subsistere nescit

Et te contempto rapitur metisque¹ relictis.

Nemo satis credit tantum delinquere quantum

Permittas: adeo indulgent sibi latius ipsi.

Quum dicis juveni stultum qui donet amico, 235
Qui paupertatem levet attollatque propinqui,

Et spoliare doces et circumscribere et omni

Crimine divitias acquirere, quarum amor in te

Quantus erat patriae Deciorum in pectore, quantum
Dilexit Thebas, si Graecia vera, Menoeceus, 240
In quorum sulcis legiones dentibus anguis

Cum clipeis nascuntur et horrida bella capessunt
Continuo, tanquam et tubicen surrexerit una :—

Ergo ignem cujus scintillas ipse dedisti
