SATIRA II.

Haeo emis hirsuto spirant opobalsama collo
Quae tibi? Ne pudeat dominum monstrare tabernae.
Quodsi vexantur leges ac jura, citari

, Ante omnes debet Scantinia. Respice primum
Et scrutare viros3 faciunt hi plura: sed illos ⁴5
Defendit numerus junctaeque umbone phalanges

Magna inter molles concordia. Non erit ullum
Exemplum in nostro tam detestabile sexu.

Tedia non lambit Cluviam, nee Flora Catullum:

Hispo subit juvenes et morbo pallet utroque. 50
Numquid nos agimus causas, civilia jura

Novimus, aut ullo strepitu fora vestra movemus?
