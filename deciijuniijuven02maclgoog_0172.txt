SATIRA VI. lea

Et cellam vacuam atque snam. Tunc nuda papillis ’

Constitit auratis titulum mentita Lyciscae,

Ostenditque tuum, generose Britannice, ventrem.

Excepit blanda intrantes atque aera poposcit, 125

Et resupina jacens multorum absorbuit ictus.

Mox lenone suas jam dimittente puellas

Tristis abit, et quod potuit tamen ultima cellam

Clausit adhuc ardens rigidae tentigine vulvae,

Et lassata viris nec dum satiata recessit,

Obscurisque genis turpis fumoque lucernae

Foeda lupanaris tulit ad pulvinar odorem.
