PREFACE. xi

Ι have not thought it right to omit any part of these Satires.
The character of the writers is seen throughout, ¹and the spirit even
of the coarsest parts is manifestly that of virtue. I have had some
experience of boys, and Ι believe that those are exceptione on
. whom such passages as are usually expunged are likely to have an
injurious effect. Wantonness is one thing, and the stem reproof
of wantonness in terms it best understands is another, and few
minds fail to see the difference. Ι have thought it enough to pass
over the worst passages without comment.

’ He who is occupied with the labours of two professions, the cares

of a large family, and the unavoidable distractione of a town life,
may claim some indulgence for the defects of awork requiring much
attention and a clear judgment at every point, and for the execution
of which only a limited time could be allowed. I have done
· the best I could under the circumstances for studente and general
readers of Juvenal and Persius, that they may be able to understand
and take an inte'rest in those writers, especially the former, who has
great charms for all that can appreciate a vigorous mind and Stoical
integrity. In this task Ι am thankful to have had the advice and

sympathy of my friend, Mr. Georgo Long.
