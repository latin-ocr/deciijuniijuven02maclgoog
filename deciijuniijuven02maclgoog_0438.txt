SATIRA II.

INTRODUCTION.

Τιιι Satire is nearly free from difficulty. It is addressed to one Macrinus on hisbirth·
day, aud Persius is led ιο ιοιιιιιι ιιι prayers his friend, ιι ιοιιιι man, will offer οι
that day with those of the generality οι men, who, while openly they appear ιο pray sor a
good understanding and a good repert, in private asir ιιι· the gratification of their meanest
desines, sacrificing their flocls in the hope the gods will increase them, and in their in·
ιιιιιιιι love of gold ollering gold to the gods, and driving out the simplicity οι ιιι old
templo service, judging divine testes by those os human corruption. The moral is that of
Horace’a address tc the rustic Phidyle, that he who brings ιι the altar clean hands ιιι ιι
honest heart may offer the humblest sacrifice and it will be accepted.

ἰιι Satire may be read with plessurs and some instruction. 'lhere is nothing forced or
unnatural in the languaga. ἰιι illustratione are not numerous, and the connexion os
ιιι parts is easily followed. Abora all, the lasson is not out of date, and as long as (iod
aud Memnon continue ιο ιι worshipped together, the impostore of hollow aud sslfish
prayerwill continue too. Itis one of the inconsisteneies of thehuman mind ιο acknow·
ledge the power of (ιιι by inrolring it to the assistance οι ιιι own wickedness, which it
must be the first purpose of that power, if it erista, ιο punish. 1Ιι has beon said persever·
iugly by the commentatore and translatore, and Addison has laid it down as a t'act in the
Spectator, No. 207, ιιιι the ideas in this Satira are talren from the Dialogus falsely
ascribed tcPlato, and called “Alcibiades Secundus? I haue looked through that spuri-
ous productiori, and can see no thought or traoe oi expression that Persius need be sup·
posed to have taken from that source ; and whether he ever read the Dialogus may be
doubtful. He had suggestion enough close ιι ιιιι, in the book he studied most atten-
tirely-the men and women about him—to have enabled him ιο write as much as hs
pleased about hypocrisy, whether it took the form of prayer or any other 3 and every
time wa imagine him borrowing irom writers rather than from real life, we degrada him
into a position he certainly does not deserve, that οι an imitator and mere rhetorician.
This remark obviously does not apply ιο ι casa like that in S. ιιι where for the sake
ol illustrating a geneml truth, which ie the subject of the Satira, ι scene is taken
imm Plato. ·

ιιι down a white mark forthis day, Macrinus, and pour libatione to your Genius. Yon
ιο ιιι need ιο take the gods apert and buy their favour, as most of our great men
ιο ; ιιι 'tis not all ean venture open prayer, banishing whispers from our temples.
lhey’ve common prayers ior strangers' ears, but mutter ιο themselves—‘Ob that
myuncle would depart this life? ‘Kmd Hercules, grant a treasure may turn up
beueath my plough’ ‘Would my ward's name were blotted from the will= he's
wmfulous and bilibus! ‘Nerius is burying his third wife' Το offer prayers like
these without offence you dip your head ιι ιιι liber twice or thrice, and wash away
the night's debaueh.

V· 17. Now tell me-’tis not much-are you prepared ιο placa Jove above-whom i-
ihi, Staius say, an uprigbt man as any. (ιο, aslr of Staius what you ask of Jove‘- '
bow would he cry, Ὀ Jupiter ι’ and shall not Jove cry out, ‘0 Jupiter !’
