force of the most we'ighty sentimenta ia broken 'by an ostentation o'f art, unseascuahle
learning, and frigid declamatiou‚ particularly in those parts which speslr of the multitude
of criminals every day producas (1v0128,sqq.), the multituda of gods (v. 40, squ), the pro·
digies to which honesty is likened (r. 62, sqq.), aad the doctrina of the philosopher!
(v. 120, ιιι). she render will judge for himself whether there is any thing frigid in
these passages, or inore artificial thau every composition ofthe lind must be. Ile says
v. 120, sqq. is en unpleasant repetition of v. 19, sqq.. and v. 126, sqq. of v. 23, sqq. ι that
the order of the argument is interrupted, ιι for instance by the story of Glaucus
.(v. los-nos), which is denied in my note; aud hythe soliloqny, which occurred to
the writer alter he had described the chamelessuess of a perjures, but which his critic

thinks he should have reserved lor a later place, mistalring the oourae of the argument ’

altogether, though it may be admitted that there is no “ ostentationi of art '³ in the
“ arrangement of the poem, which ss it professes to be a letter ιο a friend, and not
“ frigid declamation,'' ιι ιιι unnatural. lle also charges the satire with repetition, aud
ιι may be allowed that there is ι summary of the argument in the first few lines which
is ,afterwards amplified iu its seversl parts. -Ι suppose Juvenal thought it would be as
well to state his doctrine and enlurge upon it afterwards. Others will think so too.
He ιιι delivered a discourse which the world hare never oeased to admire, and of which,

in spite of the blemishes he thinks he ιιι found, Ruperti says it is “Satira egregia et ‘ ’

ARGUMENT.

Ba'd acts displeasathe doers. Conscience convicte them though the praetor’s umbo
false. All your friends feel with you; you are not so poor that you should sinls with
'such ι loss ; besides the case is common, one out of fortune's heap. Put off excessivo
grief, the sorrow of ι man should not bleze up too high, the pain should notbegreater
than the wound. Atride, amere serap of ill you scarcecun'bear, and ull your entrails
burn because ι friend will not give up a deponit, and you aman of sixty! Has not
experieuce taught you? Wisdom is great, mistressof fortune: those we count happy
too whom life has taught to bear the yoke of life.

V. 23. No day so holy but it puts forth thieres and liare. ’.ιιι good are rare, not
more ιιιιι gates of Thebes or mouths of Nile. We live in ιιι niuth a'ge, an age so
had no metal is so base that it should give ιιι name. And yet we cell upon the faith
of gods and men as loudly as the clients of Faesidius when he pleads.

V. 33. Say, art thou in thy second childhood that thou knoweat not the charmsof other
people’s money, or how they laugh ιι your simplicity, expccting any man should
not forsweer himself or think thot funes and altars have their gods? 'l'he nativos in
the golden age thought so, before ιιι skies were filled so full of gods and hell so full of
victima. ἰιιιι was dishonesty ι prodigy. 'Twas ι great crime if youth rose not to
ege, yea children to their seniore by four years. But now if friends should not deny
a trust but pey it beck entire, it ia more wonderful than all the prodigies that ever
were.

V. 71. Complain that yon're been impiously cheated of'ten sestertia! What ifI tell
of one who’s lost two hundred, and another more thau he can cram into his cheat?
’Tis easy to despise the witness of ¹the gods, if humen there be none. See with what
voice and face the man denies it. He swears by all the gods and goddesses, their
bewe, spuere, tridente, all the umonry of heaven, yse, he will boil hia son and eat him ·
pickled, if he be ι father.
