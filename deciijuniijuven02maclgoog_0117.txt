70 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Si vocat officium, turba cedente vehetur

Dives et ingenti curret super ora Liburna, 240 4
Atque obiter leget aut scribet vel dormiet intus,

Namque facit somnum clausa lectica fenestra.

Ante tamen veniet: nobis properantibus obstat -

Unda prior, magno populus premit agmine lumbos

Qui sequitur 3 ierithis cubito, ferit assere duro 245
Alter, at hic tignum capiti incutit, ille metretam.

Pinguia crura luto, planta mox undique magna

Calcor, etin digito clavus mihi militis haeret.

Nonne vides quanto celebretur sportula fumo?

Centum convivae ,- sequitur sua quemque culina. 250'
