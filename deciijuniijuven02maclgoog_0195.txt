D. JUNII lUVENALIS

Dicendi genus, aut curtum sermone rotato

Torqueat enthymema, uec historias sciat omnes: 450
Sed quaedam ex libris et nou intelligat. Odi

Hanc ego, quae repetit volvitque Palaemonis artem,
Servata semper lege et ratione loquendi,

Ignotusque mihi tenet antiquaria versus,

Nec curanda viris opicae castigat amicae

Verba. Soloecismum liceat fecisse marito.

Nil non permittit mulier sibi, turpe putat nil,
Quum virides gemmas collo circumdedit et quum
Auribus extentis magnos commisit elenchos.
Intolerabilius nihil est quam femina dives. soc
Interea foeda aspectu ridendaque multo
Pane tumet facies, aut pinguia Poppaeana
Spirat, et hinc miseri viscantur labra mariti.
