. SATIRA XII.

INTRODUCTION.

Tana isa letter toa friend who ia named Corvinus, explaining to him tha reason of the
poet¹s rejoioing on apartioular occasion, which proves to be the sale arrival of his friend
Catullus, after a stormy voyage in which hebad enecanteredthe usual dangsrs and dis·
played the usual amount of sear. Thera is some playfulnoss‚ though perhaps a little
ponderous, iu tha description of his friend’s conduct and sufferings ; but the whole oom-
position oannot have oost the writer much labour, and doesnot offer much satcrtmument.
'I'hc last thirty or lorty linesare occupied with a stroke atlagaoybunters, whom Horace
bundles so severely (particularly in S. ii. 5). Thisprofessestobe introduced lest Corvinus
should suppose all this enthusiasm for Catullus' safsty was pretendod with an eye ιο his
will. 'I'ha short answer ιο this is that the man has thnso children, and that no ono
would think it worth his while to spond tho worth of an old ben dying of pip upon a
man so situated, if his only object was to ba remembered in his will. This is the only
part of the poem that belongs properly to satire, and it is only a side-blow.

A day mora pleasant this to me, Corvinus, thahthat which gave ma birth. I've vowed a

he’s esoaped, ths ocean aud the lightning's' stroke. The skies were dark, the lightning
flashed, the sails caught fire, all like a poet’s storm. And then another horror, auch as
the picturas show hung up in Isis' temple (the painter's maintenance, asall men know).
When now tho bold was full and all the pilot's skill was of no use, then like the
beaver they began to make a bargain with the winds by tossing oargo overboard.
“ Throw over all lhave,''cried my Catullus, aud gave to their fate his finsst clothes, and
then his silver dishea huge bowls, baskets, a thousand dishes, cups of silver wrougbt
from which the Macedonian had drunk. Who else in these degenerata days would '
venture to prefer his life to bis silveri Nearly all things for use arathus disposed of,
still to no purpose. At last the mast is ont away, and the ship rights: a sad resource
is that which maims the vessel.

V. 57. Now go, commit your life ιο tha winds, trusting a roughhewn log, three or
four inobas from destruction at the best. 'And then remember what you bavato carry
when you go to sea, baskets οι broad audafat flegon and batchets for tha storm. But
when the sea fell calm and the wind fair, and futes propitious‚ the ship went on its
course with clothes spread out and but one foresail lea. The sun brought hope, the
Alban peak is seen and Ostia's basin entered, a nobler work than natura's: then tha

lips and hearts, hang garlands on the shrines, sprinkle tho kuife with moal, set out the
altars. I shall come prasently, and when that duty’s done I shall go horne ιο my
bright Lares: to these l'll offer and ιο J ove: the boughs aro on the door, and morning
