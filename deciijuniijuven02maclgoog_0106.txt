SATIRA III.

Quantum quisque sua nummorum servat in arca

Tantum habet et fidei. J ures licet et Samothracum

Et nostrornm aras contemnere fulmina pauper ιιι
Creditur atque deos, dis ignoscentibus ipsis.

Quid, quod materiam praebet causasque jocorum ⁴
Omnibus hic idem, si foeda et scissa lacerna,

Si toga sordidula est et rupta calceus alter

Pella patet: vel si consuto vulnere crassum 150
Atque recens linum ostendit non una cicatrix.

Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in sc

Quam quod ridiculos homines facit. “ Exeat,'’ inquit,
“Si pudor est, et de pulvino surgat equestri

Cujus res legi non sufficit, et sedeant hio 155
Lenonum pueri quocunque in fornice nati,

Hic plaudat nitidi praeconis filius inter

Pinnirapi cultos juvenes juvenesque lanistae.''
