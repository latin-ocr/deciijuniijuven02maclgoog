SATIRA VI.

INTRODUOTION.

'lma vigorous , and wonderfuily copious satire is written in the form of an epistle to a
person named Postumus Ursidiusf who is about to be married. The poet remonstrates
. with him upon so mad a proceeding, and takes occasion to represent the vices and follies
of women in such colours and under such a variety of forms, as might well staggera man
who intended to take a wife from that generation, and appal one who, as he supposes
may bethe case with his friend, had already committed himself to that false step. But
the friend is an imaginary person, and only furnishes the handle for such severe treat-
ment as the sex has never suffered before or since. une general truth of the picture
J uvenal drawa is sufficiently attested by other writers, and may be inferred from the
honest and genuine tone of the satire itself. Juvenal's was the heroic age of female

- corruption: there were giants ofvice in those days, as there were of passion and exalted

tendemess in the times of fable and tradition. Messallina was to wantonness what
Medea was to outraged love, and Antigone to a woman's sslf-devotion ; the difference
being that these were the creations of an exquisite imagination and the embodying of

a poet's ideal, while the other went beyond all that imagination could have conceived or ’

poets would have ventured to feign in the realities of a woman's daily licentionsness.
'l'he nature of the examples Juvenal chooses and the extravagant character of the

times he lived in limit the application of the worst parts of this satire almost to one ἢ

generation. Though all ages of refinement produce female vice and wealrness in abun-
danee, it maybe hoped if Juvenal had lived to expcse medem women to themselves and
to the world, he would, even in the worst days of their debauchery and folly, have taken
different ground, and painted his characters in less superhuman proportions; though
Dryden, by apologiaing to the ladies his contemporaries for translating the satire, leaves
the impression that it is not without its application to them. The chief interest of the
poem lies in the great powers of language and uncompromising force of indignation that
it displays‚ and in the historical picture it contains of the manners of the times.
Adultery is the vice with which the poem opens. It is said to have existed before all
others, and to have begun when the simplicity of savage life, with its rude freedom fron
temptation, gave place to the refinements of civilized society. The· increase of wealtlr
and the introduction of foreign manners through the conquesta of Rome, und the idleness

of peace, arethe causes to which Juvenal attributes, in common with others, ihc ’

deterioration of morale and the gradual growth of those stupendous vices that he
describes. Eastcrn impostures and Greek debauclrcry very quickly took root in ihc
soil of Romo, and brought forth the fruits of a rampant superstition and profligary‚
