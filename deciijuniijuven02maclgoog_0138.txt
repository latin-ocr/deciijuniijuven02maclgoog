SATIRA V.

INTRODUCTION.

rurs satire professes to bo addressed ιο one Trebius, the representative of a class of
men, who being poor end exquisitely servile, were willing ιο part with their indepen-
dence and put up with all sorts of contemptuous treatment for the sake of a dinner at
the tables of the rich. A specimen of such a dinner is given, at which Virro the host
reserves for himself and his rich friends the best of every thing, meat and fruit und
wine, end the pereniter are sulkily served with the worst, by slaves too fine to make up
to the guests for the master’s neglect. J uvenal's conclusion is, that they who will put
'up with such treatment deservo it; and the rich manis not much to blame if he
despises those who are only drawn to his table by the noae, that is, by the savour of
his kitchen.

The satire has its moral for modern society, in which, if the relationes host and
guest is prevented by good breeding frum taking the form hero represented, eating and
servility are scarcely less prominent features than they were at Rome in its worst
days. If the rich look down upon the poor, it is usually became of the homage runlr
and riches meet with ; and that this homage comes of sellishness none hnow better
than those who receive it. The caveting of what is called good society is the vice of a
rotten system5 and theman who seehs company which does not want him has no
reason to complain it his pride is galled aud his expectatione are disappointed. If thero
were no Trebiuses in the world there would be no Virros: so J uvenul thought ς and ho
does well to lay the chief weight of his satire upon the parasite.

The parasite, or diner-out, of later times had no resemblance ιο the client of the
republic. He was no more than one of many in the train ofa rich man, or of as many
rich men as he could get attached to in that mean capacity. 'l'he old relation of
‘patronus’ and ‘cliens’ so far as we can understand it, was simple and natural. The
other was the mere refuge of peverty, preferring the breed of idleness and a false
tongue ιο a life of honest lubour and the rewards of an independent mind. The
student will only be mialed if, following some of the commentutors, he looks upon the
latter condition as only another phase of the former. The old institution died out with
the republic it belonged to ; the modern practice was the fruit of human corruption,
and has its analogice in all ages of society, such as is called civiliaed.
