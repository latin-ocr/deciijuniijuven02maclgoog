nothing to recommend him. He hus horrowed without acknow·
ledgment from Ruperti ; so at least thet editor says. His remarks
are very feeble. He has added in a separate volume notes more
valuable than his own by the two brothers Valesii, written at the
end of the seventeenth century, but never before published entire.
He also hod aocess to a large number of MSS. in the imperial
library at Paris. How he used them his referen'ces are too general
to enable the readcr to judge. The only English edition I have had
occasion to notice is one by Mr. Meyer (Cambridge, 1853), intended
for the use of school· ; the chief feature of which is a large compila-
tion, from various sources, of references to other authors, classical
and ecclesiastical, some given as quotations, but most hy reference
to the places in which the passages are to be found. The object of
this is said to be “ to rescue certain authors from undeservcd oon·
tcmpt.” The authors meant are those later than the Augustan
age. Whether they are held in undescrved contempt, or whether
this commentary has helped to rescue them, Ido not know. Mr.
Mayor does not approve of Heinrich, and from the nature of his
own commentary it was not to be expected that he would. His
text professes to be that of Jahn, “except in orthography and
punctuation? In his interpretation when he has an opportunity
he follows the judgment of Madvig, in whose Opuscula there are
two essays in which some passages of Juvenal are commentcd upon.
With all respect for that eminent scholar, I do not think the inrerss
pretation of Juvenal was quite in his way. Ihave mentioned his
opinion in several places. 'l'he names of Grangaeus, Britannicus,
Henninius, and other scholare of the sixteenth and seventcenth
centurias, will be found in these notes. Their commentarios, in
part mentire, are collected in a thick quarto volume, publirhed et
Leyden by Henninius in 1695, which book Ruperti calls “indi-
gestam vanae speciososque doctrinae farraginem, rudemque rerum
inutilium molem.” It contains much that ir wrong and a great deal
that is good, and Ruperti need not have despised it. 'Phe edition of
Lubinus (Hanover, 1603) l have had by me. Ruperti looks upon
him as “verbosus nugator.” He was a learned man and the friend
of learned men, and often understood Juvenal where Ruperti did not.
