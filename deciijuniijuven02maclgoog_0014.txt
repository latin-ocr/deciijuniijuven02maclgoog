PREFAOE. ix

scholar. It has been lately republished by Duebner (Leipzig, 1839),
with the text revised but not improved by this editor, who has
added to Casaubon's notes the conflicting opinions of other com-
mentators. The notes of Lubinus are so wordy and embarrassed
as to be quite unreadable. Plum and Koenig have fumished the
world with long commentarios, of which Plum’s is the better. Pas·
sow’s edition (Leipzig, 1809) is accompanied by a German trans-
lation, and a commentary in the same language on the first Satire.
In cases of 'difficulty I have not been ableto rely upon his judg-
ment. Orelli has given the text, scholia, and many of the various
readings of Persius in his Eclogae Poetarum Latinorum. His text
isgood, and I have never failed to consider it with respect. Every
editor who thinks as he ought, independently, will have his own
opinion of his authors meaning3 and so will choose, out of many
that may have authority, that reading which best represents his
¹ opinion. With this remark I disclaim any want of proper deference
to the scholarship of others more learned than myself. Scholarship
(of a certain sort) and learning do not always go along with J udg-

ment; sometimes theytend to obscure it 3 nor are all editors
learned that contrive to seem so.

The scholia on this author, published with great care by Jahn,
are more numerous than those -on Juvenal. They passed among
scholars of the early time as the productiones one person, and he
no other than Annaeus 'Comutus the toacher of Persius. It does
not require much discrimination to see that they are not from that
source, and do not contain a syllable that was written near the time
of the poet. J ahn has taken great pains to show that they are the
work of a later Cornutus of the tenth century, who wrote a com-
mentary also on Juvenal. If this be so, he may have used notes of
earlier Grammarians than himself without ackncwledgment. 'lhere
is a great deal of useful and a great deal of foolish matter in these
scholia.

of the MSS. of Persius Jahn has mentioned and described sixty·
seven, of which the most memorable are a fragment of the first
Satira, edited by Mai from the famous Vatican Palimpsest, and
two others of the ninth and tenth centuries which bear an inscrip-
