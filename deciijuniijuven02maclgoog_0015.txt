tion, showing that they were both copied from a MS. written in
the year an. 402, by one Fl. Julius. Tho later of these, which is
at Rome, Heinrich collated. The collation of the earlier used by

J ahu is by Duabuer. 'lheir task was rendered more laborious by
the strange orthography of the MSS. and their many palpable
blunders. A more accurate and useiul MS. is one of the tenth
century (which is not however complete), in the library of Bern.

There are several of the tenth and eleventh centurias, and it is clear
that Persius, though he must have been but little understood ², was a

good deal read among the semipagani of the mediaeval monasterias, ‘

The Satires of Persius are here joined with those of Juvenal,
according to a common practice. But except for the convenience of
publication, there is nc vreason why they should be sc. United they
form a fair-siaed volume, which separately they would not do
except by extending the notes on either a an inordinate and useless
length. Persius, though older than Juvenal, yet, as being less read
and of less importance, is usually and rightly put after him.

It is easy to write long notes on such authors as these3 indeed
the difficulty is to write atmoderate length ; even without the prac-
tice, which Ι think objectionable, of overlaying the text with an
embarrassing heap of references. Among other ways of lengthening
this commentary was one which to some general readers would have
been acceptabis. Ἰ might have dwelt upon the immorality of the
age, and contrasted the practice of the heathen with the contem-
porary precepta of the Christian. But Ι do not think any observa-
tions of mine would have strengthened the language of Juvenal,
and if I have helped Christians to read and understand him, I shall
be satisfied. They will be able then to compare the profligacy of
the degenerata Roman with the purity of the Christian's profession,
and perhaps may find in the rebukes of the Satirist matter for more
useiul contemplation than that which dwells upon the vices and
superstitious of former agea, and overlooks the vices and· super-
stitious of our own.

² J ahn gives an instance of a gloss written in the eleventh century, in tho margin of
the last-named MS, on vi. 28: “ Bmtte'a Sara, in quibus Brutia superatus est.'’
