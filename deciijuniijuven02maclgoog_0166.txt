SATIRA VI. 117

Quarum non timeat pater oscula. Necte coronam

Postibus et densos per limina tende corymbos.

Unus Hiberinae vir sufficit. Ocius illud

Extorquebis ut haec oculo contenta sit uno.

Magna tamen fama est cujusdam rure paterno 55

Viventis. Vivat Gabiis ut vixit in agro;

Vivat Fidenis; et agello cedo paterno.

Quis tamen affirmat nil aetum in montibus autin

Speluncis? Adeo senuerunt Juppiter et Mars?
Porticibusne tibi monstratur femina voto 60

Digna tuo, cuneis an hahent spectacula totis

Quod securus ames quodque inde excerpere possis?
