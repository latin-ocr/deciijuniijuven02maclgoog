Well, go eud wrenthe the flnwers about your door ς ynnr wife will with one husband
be content—nny sooner with nne eye. We’ve heerd, tc be eure, οι· one who lived ¹

V. 60. In sll the portiones ond thentree con you see one whnm it were sese to wedi See
how they molt et the lescivinusdenne, and netch ench sigh nnd leern it! Others
when thestres ere closed get up their private plays. One lilres the farne pleyer,
nne the nomin, one the tregic ector, another spoils the singer’s voice. What, dn you
think eny would love Quintilian? Yon marry thet musiniano may beget your
children, or your bene msy show the fece of the mirmillo in his own. Hippin, the
senetnr’s wife, went off to llgypt with e pleyer; end e'en Cnunpns cried shcme on nur
mornls. Forgotful of her home, the wretoh, eud country, her sponse, her sister, end
her sons, yee even gemes end Poris she abandoned. Nurtured in luxury, she
despised the see3 her character she hed despised before-e triding loss among these ς
meltingdsmes. l'es, she bore the dengers of sn meny sees3 hut when ’tis duty celh
them, then they tremble. 'l'hey're hold enough for sin, but if their husbends bid them
gnon honrd, 'tis herd3 such nnsty smells, tbey're siok, the slries go round—their
stomach's strong enough when 'tis their puremours they follow. One vomits nn her
husband, while the othor dines with the seilors, wnnders about the decl, and pulls
the ropes. Whet was it chermed our Hippia so, thet she could beer ιο ιο nnlleds
plnyer’s wife? Sergiolus wns no boy, his feno was ugly, his forehead scnrred, ο wen
upon his noso, his eye scr ever drnpping. But he wos e glndietnr; this wss his
beenty, ’tvvssfor this shegeve np nll. 'lheylove the steel: let Sergius take the rudis,
end he's no better then her husband.

V. 114. Why cere for privnte heusen? Isonlr et the rivels of our gods, end henr what
Claudius hed ιο henr. His strumpet wife stole from his bed, covered her head, eud
with one slnvn girl went eud took her stend by the hrnthel door, exposed her person,
told her price, and toolr whoever ceme, ssd only when the time came round that she
must gn.

V. 133. Why should I spealr of cherms, philtres, end poisoned step-children? When
their sex's madness driven them, lust is their smnllest fault.

V. 136. But why’s Censennia virtuous‚ by her husbond’s showing? She brought him s
round sum, thnt'swhet his testimony's worth: 'twns not the bow or tnrch of love thet
won him, her money is the tornh, her dos the nrrnws. Hc buys whot liberty he hes ς
ιιο greedy men's rich wife is os e mnid3 before his fece she nods sud writes ιο her
lover. Why does Sertorius love Bibule? Because she’s pret y. Three wr·inkles,n
blech tonth, s drier elin, end then, “Pook up your beggege end begone,'’ he oriem
‘⁶ I’m tired ns you, besides you wipe your nose. Off with yon! there's another coming
with dry unse.” Till then she's o hot tyrnnt ς nsks dor the fluest wonls end wines-
ney thst’s but little-whole prisone full of slaves. Whntnver’s to be hed she buys;
goes to the fair, takes up the duest crystnls, porcelein, dismonds, such os Agrippa
gave his sister. 2

V. 161. But of so many is there nnt one good? Lot her hove beeuty, grece, wenlth,
fertile womb, encestors‚ chestity5 be she a bird ns rere esebleck swnn, who could endure
e wife with every virtue? 1 hed rnther, yee I'd rothen heve ο country girl then the
mother nl the Gracchi, if with her great virtues she's to bringa pride es great, lind
