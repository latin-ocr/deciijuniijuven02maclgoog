SATIRA XI.

INTRODUOTION.

«ἵπποιο invites his friend, whom hc calls Persicus, to dinner, und prepares him ior
plain fare by observatione on the conduct ot' those who with small meana affeci the
indulgences cf the rich, and who squander the little thoy have upon their belly. This
extravagance he associatos with seli-ignorance, and takes occasion to commend that
goldcn rule of life, Know rnrsnnr. He gives a simple account of his own table and

establishment‚ comparing his own way of living with thatof the worthies ot' former ’

days, and contrasting it with the display and profusion of modern times, in respect to
furniture, servants, and food, as well as the wanton entertainments with which the
scabionable dinners of his day were accompanied.

The time is that ot the Megalesion festival in honour oi Cybele, that is in April, and
Juvenal was not young when he wrote. The composition is in noman style, without

any appearance of imitation. Tho subject is not large, and there iano great variety ot ³

treatment. But aaa picture of domestic manners and of a houschold oi' the better sort
the satire is pleasing. If further historical evidence were needed than is abundantly
found elsewhere iu respect to the sels-indulgenceof the rich and their way of liring,this
satire would supply it. The principal commonplace is sensibly put. the simplicity ol
the olden time is described in a graphio way, there is heartiness in the invitation, and
the occasion ismarked with amane distinctness in the concluding lines.

bo see a pauper epicure, and so all talk of Rutilus. Ho's young and stout enough
for the wius, and yet (with, the prince's leave) it's said he means to train ior the
arena. There's many a man who lives but for bis palate, for whom his creditor looks
out at the entrance of the market. The poorcst live the best, just on thorcrge οι·
bnnkruptcy. Meanwhile they search the elements for dainties, regardlsss of tbs
price, or iu their heerts preferring what is dcarest. For men so reckless itis not
hard to get the money. 'l'hey'll sell their dishcs or their mother’s image, to season
