ulra OF JUVENAL. xxiii

institution of a haughty people, but now obedient to the wantonness of
a tyrant who mocked its weaknees and played with its servility, is
amusingly shown in the fourth Satira. The fifth exposes a different
sort of servility‚ that of parasitos, who sell their independence and
accept contempt for the sake of a meal grudgingly given, a low practice
which was more systematized at Rome, if i't was not much more common,
than it is in our own country. The neglect of literary men has a Satira
to itself (the seventh); aristocratia pride hae another (the eighth). The
cunning of will-hunters¹ is hit off at the end of the twelfth, which is not¹
among the most interesting of these compositione. It relatos chiefly to
the arrival of a fiiend after a dangerous voyage,'and is more of the
nature ofa familiar letter than of a satire. The dishonesty of the age

is described in the thirteenth Satine, which contains some of Juvenal's ,

finest verses, and shows him in the best character. This also is in the
form of an epistle to a friend, and so is the eleventh, which contains an

invitation to dinner, and contrasts the poet's own plainness of living with ·

the luxmious hebitsof his contemporaries. Thus Juvenal goes through all
the great scandale of his day, and treats them unsparingly. The crimes
and emminals of former reigns are fieely introduced by way of illustra·
tion, but this is because the vices of one reign represented those ol
another, and the names of the dead could be more sately used than of
the livmg. Tiberina Caligula, Olaudius, Nero, Otho, Domitian, are all
brought up from time to time to point a morel or illustrate some aspect
of crime.

The most celebrated of J nvenal’s Pfflmflt the tenth, has more of the ¹
declanntory character, which some of his critice attribute to all It is
on the vanity of human wishes, which is illustratet chiefly by histoncal
exemplos, aad the poem has aot much bearing upon the particldar
character of his times. It ie the finest specimen of that sort of com·
position that I am acquainted with. The fifteenth ,Satire is connected ,
with a scene of little general interest, an Egyptian squabble, J uvenal’s
own interest in which can only be accounted for by his having been in
the country where it happened, The lest Satire, if it had been com·
pleted, would haye fumished a sketch of military life, sarcastic but
good-humoured, from which a good deal of informatieu might have been
derived.
