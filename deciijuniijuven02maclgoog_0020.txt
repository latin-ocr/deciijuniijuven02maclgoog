LIFE OF JUVENAL. xv

that the emperor in a despatch addressed to him with the army, wrote
these words, ‘⁴ et te Philomela promovit” (alluding to his own epigram),
an'd that, learning from this the anger of the emperor, he died of a
broken heart.

The sixth memoir makes 'lhujan the emperor, Paris being still tho
hero of the epigram, and agrees with the fifth about Scotland.

A seventh agrees substantially with the first, except that the emperor
is said to have been Nero.

These seven are published at the end of Jahn’s edition.

It seems clear that not one of these notices is original. They have
come, and that not at first hand probably, hom two or three common
stocks, which have been confounded according to the fancy of the
writer3 and whatever amount of truth there may have been in the
originale has been pervertod and confused in the later editions, which
show very little evidence of accurate information.

The only authority for Juvenal's birthplaoe contained in his poema is
in Sat. iii. 319, where his friend says, “quoties te Roma tuo refici pro·
parantem reddet Aquino.” But this only shows that Juvenal was in
the habit of frequenting that town. Persius (S. vi. 7) speaks 'of the sea
on the Ligurian coast as ‘meum mare,' because he was staying there at
the time, butao one now infers from this that he was horn on that
coast ⁸. Where Juvenal was born therefore is uncertam⁶, and the
time of his birth is equally so.

That he wrote as late as the reign of Trajan, who sucoeeded Nerva
an. 983 is certain from the allusion in the first Satira (v. 47), ond the
eighth (v. 120) to the crimes and banishment of Marius Priscus, whose
exile toolr place au. 10st

Another proof is that, in Sat. xii. 75, he refers to the inner basin of
the Portus Augusti, constructed by Trajan. [If Juvenal wrote this
Satira, the conclusion from the text is hue ς and if he did not, the passage
still proves that this Satira was written after 'lhajan's port was
constituted] ,

In Sat. ri. 502, there is an allusion to the way ladies wore their hair, Ι
which seems to show that this Satira was written in the reign of Trajan,
or early in that of Hadrian (see note).

In v. 407 of the same ¹Satire, Lipsius traces a reference to the reduc-
tion of Armenia to the condition of a Roman province, by the same
emperor, in au. 106. This argument however has not much force.

’ ⁵ See Isifa of Persius.

⁸ Thereis no reason to suppose the grammarians had more authority for calling him
Aquinas than we have. In Pithoeus' Ma. it is said, “ Juvenalem aliqui Gallum propter
corporis magnitudinem, aliqui Aquinatem deant?
