336 D. JUNII JUvnNAms

Monstro voluptatem egregiam cui nulla theatra,
Nulla aequare queas Praetoris pulpita lauti,
Si spectes quanto capitis discrimine constent
Incrementa domus, *aerata multus in arca
Fiscus et ad vigilem ponendi Castora nummi, 260
Ex quo Mars Ultor galeam quoque perdidit et res
Non potuit servare suas. Ergo omnia Florae
Et Cereris licet et Cybeles aulaea relinquas ;
Tanto majores humana negotia ludi.
An magis oblectant animum jactata petauro 26⁵
Corpora quique solet rectum descendere funem,
Quam tu Corycia semper qui puppe moraris
