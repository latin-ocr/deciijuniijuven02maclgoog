ulra OF PERSIUS. xxix

The formeris supposed to be the subject, with his wife Myrtale, of
an epitaph of four lines on a ‘cippus' preserved among the Arundel
marbles, with the heads of an elderly man and woman ¹. Both these
persons were Greeks, connected, as is clear from the gentilician names
they bore, with Romen families of distinction.

Paetus Thrasea is mentioned by Juvenal, with his son-in·law, Helvidius
Priscus (S. v. 36). His character was that of an honest man in times
of the worst corruption, and his affection for Persius, which the Gram-
marian says lasted nearly ten years, and therefore only ended with his
death (for Thrasea survived him four years), was a strong testimony to
the poet’s goodness. It is said they sometimes travelled together, but
we are not told where they travelled. There is no traca in the writinge
of Persius of his having been out of Italy. Thrasea was put to death with
scarcely the shadow of a pretext, Aa). 66. The Senate condemned him
under compulsion. ·

Arria, the wife of Thrasea, was the daughter of Arria mentioned
above, and it was for her Persius wrote the lines on her mother’s death
which were destroyed with his other juvenile productione. The relation·
ship between Arria and Persius is not known.

His father, it appears, left a sister, and it would seem that she lived
with her sister-in-law after Flaccus’ death. According to the amended
text of the life Persius had an only sister. It does not appear whether
his mother had any family by her second marriage. His love sor these
ladies and his dutiful attention to them are represented as most exem· ·
plary, and to their society no doubt, as Jahn says, he owed much of that
maidenly modesty and gentleness of character which the Grammarian
attributes to him. That he was carefully watched and kept from tempta·
tion in boyhood may be inferred from what he says to Cornutus, S. v. 32,
sqq, and the same care was shown in the selection of that good man
for his teacher. His father when he died left him under a ‘tuton’
whose name is not mentioned, but who there is every reason to sup·

pose discharged his trust faithfully, for Persius died rich, lea'ving
his mother and sister between them two milliens of sesterces¹ in ready
money.

His death took place -on the 24th November, sm. 62, at his own
country house, eight miles from Rome, on the Appian road, which was
so lined with the villas of wealthy Romans that Bovillae, four miles
sarther on, was sometimes called a suburb. (See note on S. vi. 52.)
