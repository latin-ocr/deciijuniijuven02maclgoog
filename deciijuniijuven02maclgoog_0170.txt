SATIRA VI.

Pertulit Ionium constanti pectore, quamvis

Mutandum toties esset mare. J usta pericli

Si ratio est et honesta, timent pavidoque gelantur 95
Pectore nec tremulis possunt insistere plantis:

Fortem animum praestant rebus quas turpiter audent.

Si jubeat conjux, durum est conscendere navem;

Tunc sentina gravis, tunc summus vertitur aer:

Quae moechum sequitur stomacho valet. Illa maritum 100
convomit: haec inter nautas et prandet et errat

Per puppem et duros gaudet tractare rudentes.

Qua tamen exarsit forma, qua capta juventa

Sustinuit? nam Sergiolus jam radere guttur 105
Coeperat 11 11110 requiem sperare lacerto:

Praeterea multa in facie deformia, sieut

Attritus galea mediisque in naribus iugens

Gibbus et acre malum semper stillantis ocelli.
