SATIRA Ι.

INTRODUOTION.

ΤΗΙ) satire, for reasons stated in v. 47, could not have been written before an. 100
end wae probably not written long ather that date. Heinrich, whose judgmeut 1 have
egreat respect for, says itis not eo much restire os a preface or introductionto avolume
of satiree. It is certainlya satire ae severe as any iu the book. J uveual had probably
written others before it, but Ido not see enough in this poem to eutitle it to be called e
prefaoe. Hesaye all the passione of men from the fiood downwnrds arethe hodge·podge
of bis book-“ nostri farrago libelli ” (v. 86)-and he has touched upon a good many of
them in thie satire, which may be the ‘libellus ' he means. lf not, he must have been

intending to publieh acollection; for ‘ libellus' must mean something definite, either one
poem or a collection. He begins with suppoeing himself persuaded hy some person not

to write, ae Horace pretends with Trebatius (S.ii. 1). But the times ure such, he says,
that he cannot help it 5 and while there ure eo many indifferent poete sponting their lines
every where, he may aa well write aecthers. He theu goes into a detail of some of the
vile features of sooiety3 among which are the voluutary degrudation of women, their
lewdnese; the preferment of slaves aud insonuere ; the impunity of robbers, and forgers,
and morderere ; men eelling the honour of their wives ; women poisoniug their husbands;
incest and adultery nudisguieed ; avarice, gambliug, extravagance, gluttouy ; the con·
tempt aud neglect of the poor by the rich ; nrogistratee degraded iutobeggers. The burst
about the poete and their recitatione isoulya way of introducing humorously the graver
mettere thot follow. A good deal of what was recited was no doubt bad enough ς but
J uvenal'e quarrel was not with his literary brethren, whose cause he takes up, as well
as their recitatione, in the seventh satire. They have in reality nothing to do with the
. satireassuch, though Juvenal pretends they have. The argument prefixed to the MSS.
treet thie satire ee a preface to the rest. Ruperti, on tho other haud, thinks it was
written before all the othere, and Dryden that it is “the natural groundwork of all the
rest ;'' for “ herein he confines himself to nu oue subject, but strikes indifferently at
eil meu in his way i iu every following satire he has chosen some particular moral which
be would inculcem, and lashes eome particular vioe or folly.'’ lsee noproofe one way or
the other. It might heve been written first or lastfor any evidence I cen find iu the poem
itself, irrespective of the sign of the date noticed above, which puts it later perhaps theu
some.
