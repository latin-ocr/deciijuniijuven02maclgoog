utra 011 JUVENAL· xix

would put hle birth, at the earliest, in the third year of Nero, an. 56,
and I am inclined to think that this is not far from the date. [Ribbeck
has come to the same conclusion, Juvenalis Sat. Praefatio] That he
was familiar with the iniquities of Nero does not certainly prove that
he lived in his reign, and according to the above supposition he was not
more than twelve when Nero died, perhaps less, Of Domitian he writes
with a contempt and loathing which seem to be the fruit of a personal
acquaintance with his times, and amemory fullos disdain. That he
was af full ,age in Domitian's reign is certain, since he had formed an
intimate friendship with Martial before the seventh book of his Epigrams
was publishsd. That book was written sm. 93, and contains two
epigrama, one alluding, and the other addressed, to ,J avenel, in terms of
affectionatc familiarity. This alone would be sufficient proof that Juvenal
was not exiled by Domitian, at any rate till after the above year, which
was ten years after the death of Paris, and not three years before
Domitian’s. In Martial’s twelfth book tharsis an epigram (18) addressed
to Juvenal at Rome, Martial being at his native place, Bibilis in Spain.
This epigram was written between the years ao. 100 and 104, not long
after the accession of Trajan, and it supposes Juvenal to be wandering
restlessly about the town and tiring himself with attendance on great
people. 11110010100001100101101001, took place in Domitian’s time,
the cause could not have been that assigned by the Grammarians, and
it must have been of short duration.

Adopting then such data as appear to have any probability in them,
the following may be laid down as 0 sketch of Juvenal’s life, without
pretending to aocnracy, for which there are no materiale. ’

His name was Decius danius «luvenalis.

Hc was born possibly at Aquinum, in Latium, about the beginning of
Nero’s reign, that is soon after Am. 54, of respectable parents, his
father being a rich libertinus, and he himself therefore ingenuus. He
received the usual education of a Roman boy and youth, as he says (S
i. 15):

“lituos ergo manum ferulae subduximus, et nos
Oopsilium dedimus Sullae privatam nt altum
Dormirct.''

He took the ‘toga virilis' about the beginning of Vespasian's reign,
sm. 70, and having, as he says above, learnt rhetoric in the schools‚ he
¹ continued to practise it as a man, not professionally, but for his own
amusement, through the reign of Vespasian and the greater part of
Domitian's, that is, till the year Am. 94, in which year or the next he
by some means offended Domitian, and was sent by him into Egypt
with' a military command, such as civilians often received during the
Empire. In 1.]1. 96 Domitian was killed and Nerva succeeded him.
