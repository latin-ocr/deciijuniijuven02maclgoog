V. 19. My reason for following iu Horsoe's steps is this-when euuuchs are marrying
wives, und women ere exhibitiug in the creua, when s barber is chulleugiug with his
weulth ull the nobility‚ und slaves are olsd iu purple aud affecting their summer vings,
itis impossible to ubstuiu from satire. Who cau restruin himself when fat Matho
comes by in his litter, eud 'the great informer after him, the terror of all little in-
formem when you arethrust from your rights by wretches who got your inheritunce
by satisfying su old womau’slewduessf Ia it uot enough to make one’s blood boil
to ses the robber tresdiug on peopla’s heels with his crowd of sycophants, while his
werd is lofe to prostitutioui aud Marius going off into exile ιο sujoy himself with

, the spoils of his province? What does he oure for iufumy if he keeps his plunderf

Are these not flt themesfor the muse of Venusini What have I ιο do with the
old hackneyed topice when wretches ara found to wiulr at their wives' intrigues‚ aud
tslse the property of ‘the adulterer which the luw will not give to the woma'u ; when
s spendthrit’t expectato be promoted to high places for the skill with which he
heudles the reius while the grest meu louuges withhis minion behind? Does not
oue feel inclined ιο take out oue's tsblets in the very street when the forger comes
louugiug nloug in his open litter, and the greut lady meets him who hes drugged her
husband'swine undhss taught her yonngueighbours shumelessly todo the sume? Yon
mustbe e bold miseresnt if you went to be somebody. Honesty is prnised aud left to
aterve. To crime men owe all their fine gardeus, and houses, and furuiture. Who
cau sleep for the ineest andedultery thst is going ou? If nature refuses, indignation
dmws the pen, though it be but such ss mine or Cluvieuns’. ¹

V. 80. Allthe passions of meu from the deluge ιο this day are the motley subjecta of my
bools. When was the harvest of vice more abundant? when did evurice so fill its
begs? When hed the die such spirit ss now when meu plny not for the contenis
of their purse but of their chest f Imok at the hotness of the euoouuter! Ahuudred 3
sestertia lost und the poor shiveriug sluve without atuuic; is not this something more
theu mudnessi' Which of ouruucestors ever built such villas, or dined by himself
ou seven com-sesi Now-edeys the poor client hus to scremble for u paltry dole
grudgingly und cautiously given, and from this he is elbowed by some great pnuper who
must heve his share lirst; or elsa some well-todo freedmau ories, ‘⁴ 1 come first, and ¹
must be first served; 1 um rich too, end riehes are better thau ranul’ Aud ofcourse
the claim must be allowed; the rich clave before the poor magistrate, for though
money lus not yet had a temple und altars, her mejesty is above all others secred. But
ifour high odioors are not sbove rechoniug upon the sportula, what will their ³
followers do who get all they have from this source? Orowds oflitters come up for the
dole, aud all lsind of fraud goes on. ’

V. 127. 'l'he first event of this day is this sportula: then they sally forthto the forum, y
with its statues of heroes, among whom some peltry Arabsmh hes got himself set up.
Iu the astemoon they come homs; aud ut the poroh the hungry clienta take leave of
their patron und their long-cherished hope of a dinner, and retire to buy their bit
of cebbuge, while the great man sits down to the fut of the lund and the seu, and enta up l
s whole fortune offa single table. Who cau endure this benstly sclflshuessi Whata
belly that sits down to a whole bour by itself! But the penalty follows qniclr when
you go down to botho with your meet crude upon your stomach—suddeu death aud ;
intestacy, the gossip of every diuum-table, end the delight of your ungry friends.

V. 147. Our sous csuadd nothing ιο our vices, which have climbed to the highest point ς
so set your ssils, my Muse, end beer down upon the enemy. “But where is your
