SATIRA VI.

INTRODUCTION.

Punsms' last satire, like Juvenal’s is a fragment. That he wrote slowly, as the
Grammarian says, may be easily believed, and his early death may have overtaken him

ζ before he had timeto finish this poem. This would give it an interest which in itself

it has not.

The poet has retired for the winter to the coast, and is living on the shores oi the
Gulf of Spezia (Lunae portus), where, il the Scholinst is ιο be believed, his mother
lived after her second marriage. Ha sits down to write to his friend Caesius Bassus,
the lyric poet ; and alter paying a high compliment to his genius, he commeuds the
climate and scenery and retirement of the ploce he is staying at. There he lives free

¹ from all auxiety and all jealousy of his neighbours’ prosperity. He contrasts liis own

stata of mind with that of men, on the one hand, who deny themselves the necessarios
of life, and, ou the other, who run through their estate in their youth with riotous
living. He expresses his resolution to enjoy what hc has got, and advises all men to
deal liberally with their means, living up to their income, and being ready to help
a friend in time of need, even at the sacrifice of part of their estate. This suggestion
brings up the principol subject of the satire, which is the folly οι those who deny

themselves for the sake of their heim, n favourits subject with Horace. Whether it ’

was the poet's intention to continue that subject to the end of the satire, or to put in

any other point of view the spirit of money-getting, it is impossible to say. But Ἰ

Iam surprised that Ossaubon, Jahn, and others should treat tho satire as an entire
composition. It is manifestly unfinished, and so the Grammarian’s memoir ex·
pressly states.

0f Caesius Bassus not much is known. He was a lyric poet, and Persius, with the
partiality of a friend, speaks highly of his poema. But Quintilian had no great opinion
