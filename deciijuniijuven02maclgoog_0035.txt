xxx 'INTRODUCTION

He wanted ten days 16 complete his twenty-eighth ys'ar. A paragraph
in the memoir, which is from a later hand than 1116 first part, says he
died of a disease 61 the stomach. This is probably an invention, and
there is no other evidence 61 the cause 61 his death. From the company

he kept, his political feelings must have been well known, and had he
lived longer 116 might have shared the 1616 61 his most intimate friends,
of whom Thrasea, Seneca, Lucanus, were put 16 death, aud Cornutus
was banished.

He left behind him, besides the productione 61 his early years above

referred to, no more thau the six Satires in this book ³, the last of which,
¹ as appears plain to me from the ending, as well as from the obvious
meaning 61 the Grammarian's words, he must have left unfinished.
These he probablyhad communicated only to his intimate friends during
his life ς but after his death, Cornutus, whom he probably 1611 his
executor, having slightly revised the Satires, gave them 16 Caesius Bassus,
at his (Bassus’) request, to edit. Attempts have. been made to 11666 the
corrections 61 Cornutus, 6116 61 those tasks that certain understandings
delight in. The famous line notieed by the Grammarian (S. i. 121)
may very well have been written by Persius, as he says; and though his
editor could 1161 have published it without bringing disgrace and per-
haps destruction on himself, and the alteration may therefore ⁸be excused,
the verse cannot be said to have been mended by the substitution 61 the
words that now form part 61 the text. When the volume was published
it immediately attracted attention, and was much read and admired.
Since Horace uo one 61 any ability had put forth writings 61 this kind,
and in these Satires there was found much 16 remind the public of their
favourite poet, combined with a great deal 61 originality and genius.
Persius' intimate acquaintance with Horace's pocms appears in agraet
number 61 passages, most 61 which show that unconscious imitation
which is the surest sign 61 the minute study 61 au author. Casauhon
has collected a large number of parallel passages from the two authors,
some 61 which may perhaps be a little strained. Δ

Persius is said by his biographer to have been slow in composition.
This is very likely. His verse does not flow in a rapid and muddy
stream like that of Lucilius, as Horace describes him (S. i. 4), but as
he says himself “caedit pluteum 61 demorsos sapit ungues ’' (S. i. 106).
Η6 has evidently taken Horace’s advice (S. i. 10. 69, sqq.) too literally,
and corrected himself till his language has become short and th'e ideas
condensed, to a degree that makes the sense in some places obscure.
Modern readers have found great fault with the poet on this account.
But I think 1116 obscurity has been exaggerated, and that, except
