we’re no match ; they have the best of it'who never cease from acting. No woman iu
the house is safe from them, resolved ιο worm their master's secreta ont and get him
in their power.

V 114.ι Speahmg of Greeks let'tspaas tothe Gymnasra andtoaenme of deeper dye
‘l'hinlr of that Stoie who killed Barea, betrayed his friend and pupil‚ the old wretch
born at Tarsus. There⁸ rs no room for Romans here, where slaves ofGreeee are kings,
who keep their great friends ιο themselves and hrust me from theu doors hy poisonous
lies peculiar ιο their tribe3 so all my faithful services are gone. It matters nothing
now ιο lose a client.

V. 126. “What are ι poor man’s services, when praetore rush before them to do their
homage ιο rich childless ladies? 'Phe ιιιιιιιιιιί son waits on awealthy slave who
spends a tribune's pay οιι ono night’s lust, while you would hesitate to hirea
common prostituto. Bring up a witness honest as Nasica, pious ιιι Numa οι· Μι-

'tellus—first theymust knovvhis income, character comes last ι fora man's credit is as
his fortune may be. A poor man’s oath ιι nought; men langh at him, at the rent in

his cloakorshoe‚ and nothing in thepoor man’s lotis harder thanthis ridicule. ιιἰιι ³

quit the equestrian bench, you're poor: the bawd's son must sit herc, the gladiator’s,
or trainer's ;' ιο Otho has arranged it. What poor man gets a wife, οι an inheritance‚
or humblest office ι All Romans true should long ago have joined to fly their country.
Τιι hardtonse where virtue ιι kept down by poverty but hardest here ιι Rome, where
food and lodging are so dear-

V. 168. ‘'Here ιι ι man ashamed to dine off eart t.henware th so when he goes ιιοιι
Rome ιο ιιι hills and Sabine fare. In many parts of Italy no one puts on the‘ toga'
till he’ s dead. At the count ry plays yon’ll see iu the gnrssy theatra bot h tgreat and
small dressed all alike' rnt their white tunica. Here men dress beyond their means and
borrow money, ’tis a common vice, ambitious povert y Here all things must be
bought. How much will you give ιο call οιι Cossus, or for a glauce from Veiento? If
a slave’ ι hair' ιι cut οι his bcard shaved‚ cales are poured ιιι upon him, whichhe sells;

and here’s more staff ιο ιιιι your bile,· we must pay toll, and swell the savings of the ;

favourite slave.

V. 190. “And in the country who fears falling houses? Rome is shored up with bnt·
tresses; and when he has patched our honses thus, the villicus bida us aleep secure.
I'd rather live where there are no fires or midnight terrore. The lower room’s on lire-
your garret smokes and you’re asleepfyon get no notice till the flames ιιι on yon.
Codrus has little for the fire ιο take, but loses all that little, and goes forth ιο beg ι
home aud breed, and sach man turns him from his door. If rich Asturicus’ house
is hurnt ιο the ground, the town goes into mourning, business is suspended, all sorts
of costly presente ars poured in; and you might swear the man had burnt his house
himself, for he is richer hythe fire than ever.

V. 223. “If you can quit the circus, you may buy at Sora or such placesahouse for what
a garret's rent is here-aye, and a little garden and a well; there yon may hoe the
ground, end grow a feast for a hundred Pythagoreans. ’vis something, wheresoe’er

V. 232. “Here sick lmen die οι watching (and their sickness is all from undigestcd food

V. 239. “'lhe rich man rides at his ease, while the poor must push his way through l

crowds that crush his loins, or brealr his head, or troad upon 'his ιοιι, See there the

crowd returning with their dole: slaves with the hitchens οιι their heads ι their poor
