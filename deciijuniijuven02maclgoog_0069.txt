D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA ΙΙ.

INTRODUCTION.
'ihus satire is levelled st those persons in the upper ranks of society (and particularly

it would seem at the Emperor Domitian) who, pretending a stoical virtue and crying
ont against vice and calling up stringent old laws against it, were themselves practising
the worst vices in secret, and giving to the agea character which never had been equalled,
and could never be surpassed, for debauchery of the iilthieet kind. The Commentators
have generally supposed the Satine to be aimed at the professicnal philosophers of
the day. “ The poet in this Satyr inveighs against the Hypocrisie of the Philosophers
and Priests of his time,'' isTate's account of the argument. What his notioris of a
Roman priest may have been it is hard to say, but he writes:

“When hypocrites read lecturas, and a sot,
Because into a Gown and Pulpit got,
Tho' surfeitgorged and reeking from the Stews,
Nothing but Abstinence for's thema will chose.”

Heinrich, in edissertation of much sagacity, has shown that J nvenal’s meaning is very
different from this, and the scope of the poem more wida and important. The vices aud
hypocrisy of Domitian wera imitated by the respectable people, and at these he aims his
invectivas. ι

From the word ‘nuper’ in v. 29, it has been inferred that the satire was written soon
after the events there referred to, which took places.1>.83. ‘Nuper’ admits a good
deal of latitude, as it often does in Cicero, but it is reasonable to suppose that Juvenal
wrote while the matter was pretty fresh; and as the satire clearly has reference to the
time of Domitian, that it was written before his reign was over. Domitian was
assassinated in September, A. 1). 96. It is not very likely that ha gave it much
publicity while the tyraut was alive.

For indignant power there is none of the poems that excels this. 'Phe nature of the
subjects however rendere it almost nnreadable, and nothing bnt the honesty of the
writer could make the task of aditing it endurablc. Whoever would judge of the
difference between the spirit of truc indignation and that of a weak or impure mind in
dealing with such painfnl subjecta, should compare Juvenal with his translator Tabe,
who hus taken from the satire the best recommendation it has, which is the virtue of
the author. If the psalm-translator and poet-laurente was a man of purity, he has done
himself injustice. The other translatore have executed their task better in this respect.

ARGUMENT.

I would gladly run to the utmost North when cauting hypocritas dare tallr of momls,
mere ignorant fellows, though they fill their shelves with busta. No faith is in their
outside. The whole town is teeming with these solemn villains. What, yon reprore
vice, the foulest of all foul pretenders! They effect few words, and silence, and
cropped hair ; more honest far is Peribomius, who makes no secret cf his sin. I leave
him to hisdestiny; I pity him. But they are worst who with fine words attack such
vices. “1 am no worse than you,'' says Varillus the degraded. Det the straight·
limbed laugh at the bandy-legged, the fair at the blackamoor. For who would tolerate
the Gracchi complaining of sedition, nor exclaim if Verres should effect to hate a thicf,
Milo a murdarer, Clodius an adulterer, Catiline Cethegus, orSulla's pupils carpat
bis proscriptioni But such was he who, while his fatal incest was in the doing, and
while his niece was spawning her abortione, restored thebitterest laws against adultery.
