Of Juvenal's personal character it is not so easy to form an estimate
from his writings as it is of Horace’s. That his invectivas against the
vices of his timeare not the mere artistic and declamatory compositions
which some writers suppose them to be, but the fruits of an honest
indignation‚ of rare powers of sarcasm, and of a large knowledge of the
world, Ι think is manifest. His language is unreserved in dealing with
the foulest vices, but there is no‘appearance of his being himself a loose
‘ livor in any part of his writings. When Horace is coerse he betrays

ἵ ¹something of sympathy with vice, while Juvenal shows only contempt
for it. Although therefore an expurgated edition of duvenal would
have more gaps ‘than an expurgated edition of Horace, a well-regulated
mind would be less offended with the entire text of J avenai 'than with
that of Horace. dovensis morality was of a ‘higher and less technical
'sort than Horace’s‚ and has led 'some into the notion that he drew it
from the purest source, and was in understanding, if net by profession,
'a Christian. This of course is absurd. He knew human nature, and
’‘he knew right from wrong, and was not blinded by sslf-indulgence, and
‘so was ableto state the law of conscience in a way to astonish some
Christiane, to whom that lewis very imperfectly known.

Apart from his morality Juvenal was a great master of words, and
had a large fund of illustration. His pictures drawn from real life, as I
have observed in the course of the notes, are particularly happy: whether
they represent the common room of a tavern, or the deok of 'a ship, or
the inside o'f a soldier's hut or of a camp, or a schoolroom, or the greedy
crowd at the sportula, or the streets of Rome, or a drun'ken 'brawl‚ these
a'nd a hundred other soenes are so drawn that an ortist would have no
difficulty in transferring 'them tocanvas. But his hand mustbe vigorous
and his brush free, or he would do no justice to Juvenal.

There is one particular form of lust from ¹which ‘modern wickedness
shrinks, but which was one of the worst evils 'ef Roman society under
the Empire. This vice is exposed in two Satires of great power (ii. ix).
The wickedness of women was never so'unsparingly handled as it is in
the sixth Satire, a composition of extraordinery power 'and variety. The
'general degradation of Roman life and manners is exposed in the first,
third, and fourteenth Satires, and in the last of these the chief cause of
the universal wickedness is laid open in the indifference of parents to
the morals of their young children, and the example which handed down
vioe as an inheritance from father to son. The degradation of the
Senate, once the fountain of honour and authority, and the proudest
