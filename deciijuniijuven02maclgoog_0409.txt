ARGUMENT.

OGallns, who can tell the advantages of lucky service? (live me 0 successful legion
and I’ll enlist end think my sters have fnvonred me. Of course a fortunate honr
avsils one moro then if his wife or mother wrote commending one to Mars.

V. 7. First the advantagesthnt all enjoy. Tho greatest is that no civilian dares to
striks you, nay more, if yon strike him he holds his tongue and dares not show his
grievance to the praetor. If he would have revengo be has his judge, 0 01001
centurion in the camp, for soldiers may not go beyond for trial. Most just no doubt
is the centurion’s judgment, and if I’ve right upon my side he'll give me satisfaction.
But all the camp will see that my revenge shall prove a greater trouble than the
wrong. And he’s a bold man who would dare offend so many boots and hobnnils.
And who would come sofarto give his evidence? Let’s dry 000 tears, nor trouble
friends who will not fail to excuse themselves. Theman who dares to witness 10 the
assault is worthy 01 the olden times: a lying witness may be easicr got against 0
townsman than a true against 0 soldier’s fortunes and his honour. γ

V. 35. Andif 0 scoundrel neighbour moves my landmark, or debtor will not give ms
back my own, then I must wait and go through ull the law's delays, but soldiers 000
allowed the time that suits themselves and 00 drag 01000 their suit.

V. 51. The soldier too may· make 0 will while yet his father lives, for all he gets
in service is his own. The old man therefore courts his lucky soldier who by fair
favour is rewarded 00 his gallant deeds deserve. For 'tis the general's interest thst
tha bravo should also be the lucky and pride themselves upon their chains and
