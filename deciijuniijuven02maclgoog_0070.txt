SATIRA II. ⁴ 23

The most corruptmay therefore well despise these moralists, and turn the tables on
thomas Lauronia did when she heard one cry for the Julian law: “0 happy times
(cried she) with such a bulwark for its morale ! Lat the town blusb, another Cato is
come down from heaven! But whence, pray, this perfumery? If you mustcallold
lawa up from their rest, you’d better summos the Scantiniau first. Look attha men,
for they are worse than we, but their compact array aud numbers save them 3 tho
lewd will hang together: among us nought so detestable is found. Say, do we meddle
with the forum and the lawe? A few, and but afew‚ are seen in the arona. But you
will sit aad spin and do our women's work better, yea than the best of us. We all
know who was Histers heir, and by what complaisance his wife got rich3 audothers
may do likewise. And yet we are condemned 3 aud censure speres the raven to hnnt
down the dove.'’ These Stoice fled confused before the truth of her rebuke.

V. 65. What will not others do when you put ou those clothes of gaure and go and
preach before admiring crowds against the female sinuers, Creticus? They would at
least put on a decent toga if it came to that. ‘⁶ But it isso hot‚” say you: why then
govmksd 3 madness is less disgraoeful. Look at the dress in which, had yon lived
then, our hardy anoeetors had seen you in the rostra. Wonld you not cry out,
“ Heaven and earth !’' if you saw a judex so attired? How would a witness look in
clothes like these? And yet yon, atera unbending Stoia go transparent!

V. 78. 'l'he infectior has spread, and will further spread, like murrain among sheep. or
sourf in pigs, or contagione mt from grape to grape. Yon will go on to something ’
worse than this. The height of wickedness is reached by slow degrees. Soon we

shall see you among those who mock the rites of Bona Dea, driving out the women, ,

and keeping up such orgies as the Baptae tire Cotytto with. They wear long garlanda
on their heads and jewels on their neck, endecades, and pour libatione. Here one
' points his eyebrows and makes his eyes look languishing: another drinks from an
obscene glass with his ,long looks tied up in a net of gold, with a handsome tunic,
while his slave swears by his master's Juno! Another holds a mirror to his face such
as vile Otho carried when be went to the wara 3 anovelpieoe of fumiture fora camp!
Of course it is a great man's part to kill a tyrant-and to mind his skin3 to aim at

’ empireo-and to smooth his face. Semiramis and Cleopatra did not so. Herais no

reverenoe for the table, none 3 but Cybele's foul licanoe and tbe languishiug voice, a
fanatic high priest with his white bair, rare glutton he and master of his art. Isong
since they should bave cut their useless parts, as the Phrygiae priests are went.

V.117. Gracchus bis portion brought to a trumpeter: the marriage deeds were signed 3
the blessiug spoken 3 the feast prepared 3 the new bride lay upon his husband'sbosom.
Ye nobles! need we the censor or the haruspex here? What if a woman calved or a
cow lambed? you’d sbudder more and count them greater monsters. 'Ibe priest of
biars who sweated with the ancilia puts on a brida! dress! Gradivus, whence this
sbame to Latin shepherds? whence have thy sons this itoh? Amen of birth and
wealth marries a man, and yet thy wrath is still! quit then the plain which thou dost
so neglect. “I must be up betimes, and do my duty by the Quirinal.'' ‘⁴ What uutyl'f
“What duty! why my friend will take anhusband-thc marriage will be private.”
But soon there'll be no privaoy, they’ll want to put it in the news. And yet they
must die barren (this tormenta them), in spite of herbe and the Lupercus' blows.

V. 143. But this is less thou noble gladiatore, who soour the arena, better born than all
the fine folk who look on by the podium, yea than the great man too who gives the
gamas. The fables about manes, Styx, and Charon's boat we leave to babes. But
only think them trae, aad what would all those mighty spirits say when such a

shade came down! They'd ory for lustral water, sulphur, piae, and laurel.
V.159. So changed are we, alas! Our arms are carried to the furthest North, but those
barbarione do not what their conquerors do. Yetono, Armenian Zalates, more soft
