SATIRA IV.

sarran iv.

INTRODUOTION.

Tnu man Crispinus mentioned in the first satire (v. 26) as a coxcomb who had been im·
ported a slave, and had risen to consequence by the favour of Domitian, is here introduced
again. A piece of extravagance of his is'made the handle for introducing the story of a
fish of immense size which was once caught in the Adriatic, and presented bytho fisher·
manto Domitian at his country palace on the Alban lake. The tyrant, by way of
showing his contempt for the senate, summoned them suddenly, a's if on matters of state,
to attend him from Rome, for the purpose of giving their opinions upon the fish and the
manner of dressing it. The satire turns upon this point, the degradation of the senators,
some of them honourable men, whom, as well as others who were not so, he mentions by
name. The poem was written after the death of Domitian, which is referred to in the
lasttwo lines. lt is difficolt to say how soon alter, but Crispinus still retained the
wealth he had acquired under Domitian, and we may believe it did not stay with him
'long under the next reigns. The sketches of the different senators are very good. They
are evidently drawn from life; and no better scene was wanted or could be invented to
represent the abject condition of the principal men of Rome under this insolent tyrant.

ARGUMENT.

Crispinus here again-and he must often play his part—monster, without a virtue
toredeem him. What use is all hiswealth to him? Thebadareneverhappy,much
less the adulterer and the incestuous. But now of smaller matters3 though in another
this were bad enough. But what is to be done where men are worse than all that can
be said of them? ,

V. 15. He bought a mullet of six pounds for as many sestertia: not as a present for
some rich old man or for his mistress 3 no, he bought it for himself. He, the Egyp-
tian slave! a fish cost more than the man that caught it, nay, more than an estate
in the provinces. What shall we think that emperors eat when such a side-dish
gorges the parasite of the court, now first of equites, who used to cry stale flsh in his
native place?

V. 34. Let’s sit, Galliop'e ; tell atrue tale, ye Museschaste and young: andriace I call .
you so give me your favour.

V. 37. When our last Flavius was torturing the world, it happened a huge fish was
taken atAncona, not less than they which alter winter's ice float from Maeotis to the
Euxine. The monster straight is marked for the high-priest, for who would dare to
sell it with the coast full of informare, ready to swear the fish was reared in the
imperial ponds, and must go back to its lord? They tell ur all that’s good in the sea
belongs to the privy purse, so it's sent as a present in fear of confiscation.

V. 56. The winter had set in; the manin haste, as if 'twas summer and the fish would·
spoil, makes for the palace. And when he gete to the lakes where Vesta dwells, a
crowd admiring steps him; when it parts the doors fly open ; the senate waits with·
out. He's brought to the great man. “Accept (sayshe) an offering too hig for
private tables: make merry, eat, this fish was kept for Caesar’s days. ltself was
anxious t'o be caught.” The flattery is too gross, and yet his feathers rise; greatness
will swallow any thing. Butnow there is no dishtohold the monster. So he callsa
muncil of the men he hates, and on whose faces sit the terrers of a great man's
friendship.
