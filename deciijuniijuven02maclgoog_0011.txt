assertion, and in many cases I have preferred the readings of other
MSS, of whichRuperti has given a catalogue and description. I ,
myself am in possession of one which is not in Ruperti’s list. Itis ¹
neatly written on parchment in 8vo. form, but is incomplete and of
no particular value, being an Italian MS. of the early part perhaps
of the fifteenth century. As it is not a transcript of any MS.
referred to by other editors, Ι have occasionally noticed it, and

have rejected.

I have not followed implicitly the judgment of any editor. Jahn
and Hermann rely too much I think on the MS. they do well to

industrious man of weak mind, always liable to waver when his
judgment happens to be right, but never to be relied upon in cases
of difficulty. Nor is he strictly honest, for he changed his interpre-
