a few passages, the Satires arc as free from difficulty as most ol
Juvenal's‘.

They were much admired by the ancients‘, and have been abun·
dantly quoted by Grammarians, by Fathers of the Church, and
mediaeval writers. If certain passages are less familiar to modern
ears than their fitness for quotation might lead us to expect, itis from
the difficulties of the poetry‚ which have deterred men of our day from
reading it ae lt deserves. The subject of the first Satire, which deals
with the vicious poetical teste of the day, and has many quotations from,
or imitatione of, the verses of contemporary¹ writers, would be more in· Δ
teresting and intelligible when it was first published than it is to us,
and this Satira alone would create a large demand for the volume. The
Epistle to Macrinus comes more home to ourselves as dealing with the
worship of (lod, the selfish or worldly abusa of which is common to all
ages. The introduction I have prefixed to the third Satira may per·
haps lead some to read it with curiosity, and they will not be disap-
pointed. The more I read it, the more Ι admira it. Seli-ignorance is
a large subject, which might be better handled than it is in the fourth
Satira 3 and the folly of running after and hoarding money to be equan-
dered by one’s heire is not done as much justice to in the sixth as it
probably would have been if the poet had finished it. The fifth is
generally considered the best in the book, though I myself prefer the
third. In the fifth there is that tribute to the goodness of Cornutus
which proves the goodness of the writer and the gracefulnees with which
he could write. It also shows more of the philosophical school in
which Persius had been trained, without however introducing any thing
more new than the Stoic doctrine that the only free man is the
saga, with which Oioero and Horace had before made their readers
familiar. There are more imitatione of Horace in this Satira than in
any other.

A writer of satire may be ‘ferus et violens’ with his pen, and yet
very amiablc in manners, as the Grammarian describes Persius to have
been. He may also in those days have been chaste and modest, and yet
have used language for the exposure of vice which now cannot be used,
or even read without discomfort. There is nothing in Persius’ style to
contradict the pleasing description given of him by his biographer, which
probably was quite truc. More than one gem now in existence has

⁴ J ul. Scaliger thought Persius wrote obscurely on purpose that fools might admira
him. Heisvery severeon Persius. (See Scal. Poetvi. c. 6, iii. c. 97.)
⁸ Quintilian (x. 1. 94) says, “Multum et verae gloriae, quamvis uno libro, Persius
meruit? Martia} (iv. 29) says, ,
“Saepius in libro numeratur Persius uno
Quam levis in tota Marsus Amazonide.”
