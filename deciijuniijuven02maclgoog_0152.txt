SATIRA V.

'l'u scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodit,

Qui tegitur parma et galea metuensque flagelli

Discit ab hirsuta jaculum torquere capella. 155
Forsitan impensae Virronem parcere credas.

Hoc agit ut doleas: nam quae comoedia, mimus

Quis melior plorante gula? Ergo omnia fiunt,

Si nescis, ut per lacrimas effundere bilem

Cogaris pressoque diu stridere molari.

'l'u tibi liber homo et regis conviva videris:

Captum te nidore suae putat ille culinae,

Nec male conjectat. Quis enim tam nudus ut illum

Bis ferat, Etruscum puero si contigit aurum '

Vel nodus tantum 05 signum de paupere loro? 165
Spes bene coenandi vos decipit. “ Ecce dabit jam

Semesum leporem atque aliquid de clunibus apri:

Ad nos jam veniet minor altilis.” Inde parato

Intactoque omnes 05 stricto pane tacetis. ,,
