Another manages the other side: and then the old woman is called in who once was
clcvcr at ιιι crisping pin, hut now is sent ιο mind the spinning. They give their

hage eunuch priest, bow he comes into her room, with solemn talk frightens and
hids her buy off anturnn's ills with a hundred egge, and give her clothes to him, that

hcarts of dovcs‚ or dogs, or chickens, sometimes even boys, ιιι ιιιι ιι turns

V. 553. Chaldaeans ιιι more trusted still. Whate'sr ιιι astrologers may say must he
