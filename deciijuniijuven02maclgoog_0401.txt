351 D. J UNII JUVENALIS

Hujus enim quod nunc agitur miserabile debet

Exemplum esse cibi; sicutmodo dicta mihi gens

Post omnes herbas, post cuncta animalia, quidquid
Cogebat vacui ventris furor, hostibus ipsis 100
Pallorem ac maciem et tenues miserantibus artua,
Membra aliena fame lacerabant esse parati

Et sua. Quisnam hominum veniam dare, quisve deorum
Viribus abnuerit dira atque immania passis,

Et quibus illorum poterant ignoscere manes ,105
’ Quorum corporibus vescebantur? Melius nos

Zenonis praecepta monent3 neo enim omnia, quaedam
Pro vita facienda putat. Sed Cantaber unde

Stoicus, antiqui praesertim aetate Metelli?

Nunc totus Graias nostrasque habet orbis Athenas. ,110
