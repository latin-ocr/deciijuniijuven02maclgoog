234 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Exstantem, ct medio sublimem in pulvere Circi

In tunica J ovis, et pictae Sarrana ferentem

Ex humeris aulaea togae, magnaeque coronae

Tantum orbem quanto cervix non sufficit ulla? 40

Quippe tenet sudans hanc publicus et, sibi Consul

Nc placeat, curru servus portatur eodem:

Da nunc et volucrem sceptro quae surgit eburno,

Illinc cornicines, hinc praecedentia longi

Agminis officia, et niveos ad fraena Quirites 45

Occursus hominum, cujus prudentia monstrat

Summos posse viros et magna exempla datruos

Vervecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci. 50

Ridebat curas nec non et gaudia vulgi,

Interdum et lacrimas, quum Fortunae ipsc minaci

Mandaret laqueum mediumque ostenderet unguem.

Ergo supervacua aut perniciosa petuntur,
Propter quae fas est genua incerare deorum. 55
