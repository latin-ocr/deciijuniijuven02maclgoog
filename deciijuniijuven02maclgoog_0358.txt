SATIRA XIII. 309

Ingenium dulcique senex vicinus Hymetto, 105

Qui partem acceptae saeva inter vincla cicutae

Accusatori nollet dare. Plurima selix

Peullatim sitiantque errores exuit omnes,

Prima docet rectum Sapientia3 quippe minuti

Evasisse putes quos diri conscie facti

Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum? 195

Quas et Caedicius gravis invenit aut Rhadamanthus,

Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.
