D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Usque adeo nihil est, quod nostra infantia caelum

Hausit Aventini, bacca nutrita Sabina? 85
Quid, quod adulandi gens prudentissima laudat
Sermonem indocti, faciem deformis amici,

Et longum invalidi collum cervicibus aequat

Herculis, Antaeum procul a tellure tenentis,

Miratur vocem angustam, qua deterius nec

Ille sonat quo mordetur gallina marito.

Haec eadem licet et nobis laudare3 sed illis

Creditur. An melior quum Thaida sustinet, aut quum
Uxorem comoedus agit vel Dorida nullo

Cultam palliolo? Mulier nempe ipsa videtur 9⁵ ι
Non persona loqui : vacua et plano omnia dicas

Infra ventriculum et tenui distantia rima.
