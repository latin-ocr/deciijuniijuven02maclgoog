SATIRA ΙΙΙ. 15

breath 'l'he slaves at home are busy with their master’s bath and supper, while he,
poor wretch, is shivering by the Styx without a sarthing for the ferryman.

V. 268. “ The night has other dangers-such'as pots from the lofty windows ; count
yourself happy if yon get no more than their contente. A wise man malros his will
before he walks abraad at night.

V. 278. “A drunken rioter meets you, who slseps not till ho kills his man. But,
drunken though he be, he knows how to avoid the rich man's train and torches; while
l’m his viatim,¹ who go forth by the light ofa candle or the moon. This is the way ho
picks aquarrel (isthac he quarrel where ona gives, the other does but take the 111000)-
heplants himself before you ς ‘Stopl’ says he, and you perfores obey. ‘Where are you
stom? whose vinegar and beans have filled your bellyi' what oobbler were you supping
with tonightf What, not a word? Speak out, or I shall kick you. Where do yon
stand, and where is your proseuchaf’ Whether you speak or not it's all the same.
He knochs you down, then drags you into court. This is the poor man's licence when
he’s beaten, to pray he may be suffered to carry home a few taath in his head.

V. 302. “Then when your doors are closed and barrad the robber breaks into your
house and robs or murders you. For thieves come 1ο the town as their preserve.
Their fetters soon will leave no iron for our tools. Happy our ancestors, who with
one prison were content! ’

V. 315. “But 1 must go ; the horsea and the driver are impatient, and the sun is set-

, ting. Farewell, remember me3 and when you go to Aquinum send for me, and l'll

’ come help you write another satire.’'
