woman’s cry: no seusible man thinks efthatz what good would it do ii he could tortura
the man to death? Resides, if he wanted revenge there was conscience to do that work
for him, tha haunting presence of the liar's gnilt spoiling his meals, severing his blood,
disturbing his sleep, adding terror to the thunder and despair to sickness, hinderinghis
prayers and standing for ever between himself andthe gods he has offended. rvofaror
his repenting: nature will be too strong for him, and will go back ιο tho gniltthnt con·
science has condemned3 and so he will go' from siu to remorae, and back again to sin,
till at last he will be caught iu his own snare, and come to the punishment of the selon,
and prove ιο the satisfaction oi the vindictive soul that the gods are neither deafnor blind.

The satire takes the form of expostulation and ironical consolation throughout. Itis
Ἴ mostfumiliarly knownasdeahngwiththe subject olan accusing conscience, whiohitdoes
in avery powerful way from v. len ιο 235. But this is only one part of the whole. 'lhe
characteres the times and thecontrast of the past and present occupy much of the poem,
and there is a very line passage describingthe way in which men temper with guiltsnd
argue themselves into the commission of it, aud put on a bold face as of innocense, from
v. 86 ιο 119.

Gifford says, ‘⁸ Juvenal is here almost aOhristian,” and he speaks ofthe doctrines con·
tained iu this satire “ as of such pure, such sublima morality '' as ‘⁴ the light of nature
alone was incapsble of discovering ς aud which the author undoubtedly derived from that
‘true light ⁹ which now began to glimmer through the Roman world,’' and more to that
effect. 1 have made a remark ou this subject in one of the notes (v. 209). But forthe
chronological difficulty thero ere many who would say that¹ the same light glimmoredin
the mind of Socrates, whose viewa of the snper-vision oi (iod and the power of conscience
were not las clear thau J uvenal’s, though we have no such powerful expositiones his
ideas as we have here. There never was a timo when conscience did not exist in tha

. mind of man, however completely the habit οι guilt moy have seared it iu some aud have

given a colonr of innocenceto wickedness in the jndgmeut of whole communities. What
Juvenal says on the subject of conscience derives its only weight from its truth; and
though he exaggerates whon he leads to the inference that the stiugs ofn guilty conscience
must necessarily follow gnilt‚ the picture he draws is taken from experience, not from
revelation, the experience of those who were no Christinns and had uo knowledge to
frighten them hut that which avus suggested from within. The soliloquy (v. 92-105)n
which aman argues away the misgivings with which he enters upon crime or the denial of
it, represents no doubt the conduct and feelings of many whohave more light then that oi
conscience 3 but there too the man is not a bad Christian, but a bad pagan ς and if we are
surprised to read in Juvenal language or sentimenta which if delivered from a Christian
pulpit wouldbe appropriate and menching, it ishecause we are apt ιο forget that human
nature, wlth its desines, its corruptions, and its sslf-deceptione, has always been the same
in the main,and that Gon has never been without hiswitness against guilt in the heartoi
man. That revenge is unphilosophical and vindictiveness the proof of a little mind may
be affirmed without more light than man has always possessed. But this doctrina in par·
⁴ ticular it is of which Gih'ord declares that “neither Thales nor· Chrysippus, no, nor his'
great master Zeno ever taught or even conceived '' it. How does helmon thia? nenos
not add that Socrates did not act upon it, es J uvennl (who does not look to Christianity
' for his exemples) says he was ready ιο do. sno if he acted the doctriua he preachsd
it, as, if Plato is to be trusted, ,he equally did in words ι οι· if he did not Plato did it for
him, and that comesto ιιο same thing. '

The sum of this is that the render had better take up this satire as representing the
common moral sense of mankind, ond look ιο the law of Christianity aa confirming the
unwritten law of which conscience has always been tho guardian and theexpouent, and
of which such writings aa iuvenale, especially this poem, are the olearest evidence.

Ruperti has pointed out what he considers defecto in this satire. He says that the
