D. JUNlI JUVENALIS

Unguibus va saeva fertur grue. Si videas hoc 170
Gentibus in nostris, risu quatiere: sed illic,
Quanquam eadem assidue spectentur proelia, ridet
Nemo, ubi tota cohors pede non est altior unc.

“Nullane perjuri capitis fraudisque nefandae
Poena erit?” Abreptum crede hunc graviore catena 175
Protinus et nostro (quid plus velit ira 1) necari .
Arbitrio ; manet illa tamen jactura, nec unquam
Depositum tibi sospes erit, sed corpore trunco
Invidiosa dabit minimus solatia sanguis.
“At vindicta bonum vita jucundius ipsa.''
Nempe hoc indocti, quorum praecordia nullis
Interdum aut levibus videas flagrantia causis.
Quantulacunque adeo est occasio, sufficit irae.
Chrysippus non dicet idem nec mite Thaletis
