no difficulty about. So 10100 this Ι admit: hs has proved clearly
enough that there are very manifest differences between thematter and
the style 01 the ten Satires which he assigne to Juvenal, and the five
which he has handled so unmercifully. These five Satires are marred
by great faults, and 0001010 comparatively few good lines. They are
indeed feeble compositione as satires, when compared with tho vigorous
work 01 the earlier pieres, the beet of which are perhaps 111000 which
cannot be read with young men. If any 801110 01 the five is to be
excepted from this general condemnation, it is the thirteenth; but many
parts even 01 that 801110 010 open 10 just censure. As to thelamone
tenth, if we do not except 10 the matter, we may allow that there is
some merit in the manner in which the subject is treated; but even 11
this admission ie made, it is still nothing 01010 than a frothy declama·
tion. Both the matter and the style 01 the tenth 10101 0 striking contrast
to another 801110, the third, which ie justly admired. It is a living
picture.

The question thenis, whether the same man wrote 01 could write 011
these Satires, a question which Ribbeck answers by affirming that he
could not 3 and he labours hard to prove his assertion. But it is im-
possible to say what a man may do in the way 01 writing, for the same
men have written wise books and foolieh books, bad poetry and good
poetry. The same difficulty existe ae 10 001110 01 Cicero's 01011000,

which 010 ao bad that some excellent critice maintain that Cicero .

could not have written them ; but on the other hand there are critice,
both old and new, who admire the spurious oratione, and think they are
very fine. '

Ae 10 the sixteenth 801110, which is mauifeetly 0 fragment, it 10
admitted by Ribbeck that thie may be a pieoe 01 the true Juvenal’s
work.

In a second chapter Ribbeck discusses the interpolatione in the ten
Satires. His hypothesis, he says, about the five Declamations would
1010 badly, if we accepted the ten Satires in their present form as the
genuine work 01 Juveua13 101 all the faults which have led him to
reject the five Declamations, are found here and¹ there in the 100
Satires 3 and these bite 01 patchwork resemble so much the whole texture
01 the five Declamatione, that 11 110 allow them 10 stand where they
are, we must admit that the poet could exhibit in the same Satirethe
skill 01 0 master and the stupidity 01 0 bungler. However, there ie 00
necessity, he says, 101 thie admission, 101 the ten Satires are dis·
figured by interpolatione which have been remarked on by many recent
critics; and indeed nobody who hae read Juvenal with any care will
deny that there are interpolated verses. Ribbeck 1100 only increaeed the
number 01 them. There are two long passages, which Ribbeck assumes
