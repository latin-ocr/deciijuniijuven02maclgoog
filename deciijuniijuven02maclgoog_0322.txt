SATIRA XI.

Idem habitus cunctis, tonsi rectique capilli

Atque hodie tantum propter convivia pexi.

Pastoris duri est hio filius, ille bubulci:

Suspirat longo non visam tempore matrem

Et casulam et notos tristis desiderat haedos,

Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris,

Quales esse decet quos ardens purpura vestit: 155
Neo pugillares defert in balnea raucus

Testiculos, nee vellendas jam praebuit alas,

Cressa nec opposito pavidus tegit inguina gutte.

Hic tibi vina dabit diffiisa in montibus illis
Aquibusipse venit, quorum sub vertice lusit: 160
Namque una atque eadem est vini patria atque ministri.
Forsitan exspectes ut Gaditana canoro

Incipiat prurire choro plausuque probatae

Ad terram tremulo descendant clune puellae :
