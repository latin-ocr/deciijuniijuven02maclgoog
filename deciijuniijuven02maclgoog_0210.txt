SATIRA VII.

INTRODUOTION.

Τιιιι ιιιίιι turns on the neglect οι literary men by the rich. Poeta are left ιο starve or
get their bread by menial callings ς historiam are no better off3 lawyers and school·
masters are put off with the shabbiest fees, and men will spond their money on any thing
rather ιιιιιι their sons' education. This is the most forcihle and instructive part οι the
satire, which describes the weary taak οι the schoolmcster, the little retnrnof gratitudo
he gets, and the exacting demands οι parente who expect every thing and will pay little
or nothing. The toacher who in the good old times, Juvenal says, was treated with pro·
found respect, in his day was insulted hy parents and therefore by pupils. Ιι the boy is '
ablockhead and cannot learn the master gets all the blame.

The only patron learned men have, says Juvenal, is the emperor, and it has been much
questioned which emperor it could have been. The statement is most in accordance with
what we hear οι the reign οι Hadrian, during which he managed to encourage the arta
and literature atRome, though he was absent the greater part οι his time. 'Ihe subject
isdiscnssed in the Life of Juvenal, to which the reader is referred. '

ARGUMENT.

The hope and purpose οι our studies is in Caesar only. He only cares for the
Muses in these times when poeta leave the valea οι Helicon and live by batha, by
baking, auctioneering. For if Pierian woods won't give you breed, yon must e'en ply
the euers trade* ιιι the Atria. And this ιι ιιιιιι than to lie in thie conrts, though
knight tofa Asia and Bithynia do it.

V. 16-35. But this ιι past, no poet now shall be degraded to do drrty work Up and
hestir yourselves, my friends, the prinoe is secking whom he may reward. If you
are waiting for another patron, go put your books' ιιι the fire or leave them to the
wormat go break your pena and wipo out all your lines ς the rich have learnt to
admim and praise yon, as children do the peacock. But the mefirl years οι life are
passing, and when old age comes on with wearinesa and poverty, it hates itself and
its own Musa.

V. 36- 47. Thisia the way theman you worship, leaving the Muses and Apollo’ s temple,
contrives to give you nothing. Being himself a poet (cqnal to Homer save in years),
ἰι yon’ re ambitione to recite your poema he lends yon a dirty room a long way off,
bolted ιοι· yeara aa safe aa the gates οι abeleaguered town: he sends his freedmen ιο
applaud 3 but he'll not give aa much as the benches oost to hire. ι

V. ιιι-97. And yet we go on at this work, plonghing the sanda laboriously. Ιι yon
should give it up, the old habit pulla yon back; ιοι· with too many the itch οι writing
iaincnrable and goes on to old age in their weary hearts. But a rare poet, none οι
your common sort, such aaI only can conceive not name, is made ιο by a careless
mind, free from all bitterness, loving the woods and Muses' springs ’Tis notior
poverty ιο· sing in caves and wield the thyrsus. Horatius was full when he cried
Euae! What room ιοι genius if other cares than hia own verse dist urb the poet's
