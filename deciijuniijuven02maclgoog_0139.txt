92 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

reward for which yon are ready tc break your rest, toanticipate your brother parasite·
st nneout thhours of the morning The wine is such that wool refuses it. It turns
the gues tstoCorybantes, squabblingt first, and tben throwrn cups to break each other’s
heads; ·the host meanwhile' rs drinking the oldest winae, of which he’d grudgcs
cyathus ιο a friend who'd got the heartbnm. Ηο has fine cups of umber set wrt 'th
st ones 3 if the like rs given to you, a watch ss set to see your nails are not too busy.
There's some excuse for him, · for Virro, like his neighbours, stioks hisfinest jewels on
his cups. But long- nosed carthenware and cracked rs good enough for you. The
master gets his water seed not you A blaok slave hands your cup, such es ‘you ’d fesr
to meet among the tombs the flower of Asia wsits οιι him, bought et a price beyond
the weal thof kings. He's much too great to mix a poor man’ swina. His beenty aud
his age become his pride. He' s angry at your sitting while het s tands. Every great
house is full of these prend menials. One hands yon snlkily a ernst of hard and musty
breed ιο try your teeth; the fine white loaf is kept for the masters eating. Thera’s
one stands by ιο οοο you keep to your own breed-basket.

V. 76-106. And this, you cry, was what I left my home ferend braved the rain and
winde of the Esquiline! See that gresd lobster on a noble dish, that looks down scorn-
fully upon the guests-thut goes ιο the master. You get a scanty crab with half eu
egg-a sort of funeral dinner. Ηο oils his ιιοι with fine Venafrum while your poor
eabbage stinks of the lentem and such stnff as Libya sends, and such thet Romanswill
not bathe with blacks, and snakes turn from thern. The mester gets his mullet from
the provinces (for craving bellies sweep them from our sees) and lempreys caught by
venturous fishermen in the Sicilinn strait: while you must put up with an cel likea
long snake, or river fish all spotted with the frost and fattened in the sewers.

V. 107-113. But now a word with the rich man himself. Nobody ssks of youths
bounties good rich men of old would send to their poor friends. In those days tp ιο
connted bountiful was rnore esteemed than fasces and inscriptions. We only beg you'll
dine as u citizen should3 then spend your money as yon plesse.

V. lle-124.. See before the host is a fat goose's liver anda fowl as big as a gesse, a
boar that Meleager might have killed, and truffles if ’tis spring. (¹ Keep your corn.
Libya: the glutton ories, ‘but send us trufiles.') To make one angry as ean be, you
see the carver fionrishing his knife and dancing till he goes through all his lesson.
'Tis of the first importunae with what gestures hares and fowls are cnrved.

V. 125-131. You’ll be dragged by the heels and put out of the door if you venture to
open your mouth, as if you were a freeman horn. Do you suppose the great man
will ever drink ιο youi Is any of you so holdas ιο pass hi11'1the cup and say ‘Drink ι’
There are many things a man dare not say with holes in his eost.

V. 132-145. But if the gods or some good man gave yon a fortune, what a friend you
would scon become of Virro's! “ Here, help Trebius, put it before Trebius: allow mc,
my deur brother, ιο help yon from the loin.'’ It's the money that is dear brother.
But if you want ιο ιο the mester’s master, you must not have a little son or daughter.
A barren wife makes pleasant friends. But if your wife presente yon with three
fine boys et a birth, there’s no offenoe. The Virros will adore your little brood.

V. 146-155. Suspicione mushrooms are for the poor friends, boletus for the muster.
Phaeacian apples, stolen you'd think from the Hesperides, are for the host sndfavoursd
guests: you faed but on their smess, and eet such rotten fruit as the monkey gnuws
on the gout's back learning his drill.

V. 156-173. Perhaps you think 'tis stinginess in Virro. He does it ull to vex you.
What fun so greum as a disappointed belly? He wants ιο see yon cry with rege and
gnssh your taath. Yon think yourself e freeman and tho rich one's guest: he thinks
the small ofthe kitchen draws yon, and he’s right. What freemen is so poor thet he

ι would bear such treatment twice? You're cheatod with false hopes of a good dinner.
