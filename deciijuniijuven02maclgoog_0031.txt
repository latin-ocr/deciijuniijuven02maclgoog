xxvi INTRODUCTION.

‘Odouuopmd¹‚ and a few verses for the wife of Thrasea, on her mother
Arria, who had killed herself before her husband ⁵. All these Cornutus
advised his mother to destroy. When his book was published, meu
began forthwith to admire and tc seize upon it ⁸. . [He died 01 a dmease
of the stomach in the thirtieth year 01 his age ². But⁸ afterwards, when
he had left his school and teachers, having read the tenth book of
Lucilius, he conceived a great desire to write Satires. The beginning
of that book he imitated ⁰, first intending to abuse himself¹, and alher-
warde every body, which he did with such invectivas against the modern
poete aud oratore, thet he eren attached Nero, the miguing emperor.
The verse he wrote against Nero was as follows:

Ι ‘Auriculm Asini Mida rex habet,'

but it was corrected by Cornutus 111 the following way:

‘Auriculas Asini quis nbn habet l’

lest Nero should think it was said against himself.”]

Persius then, as he has always been called in modern times rather
than by his cognomen, Flaccus, by which his contemporaries knew him,
was 01 equestrian rank, and was born at Volaterrae (volterra), in
Etruria, on the 4th of December, nn. 34, the twenty-first year 01
Tiberius. His father Flaccus died when he was six years old, and he
remained under the cere of his mother Fulvia Sisennia at his native
place, where he went to school till he was twelve years old'. Like
Horace, he then was taken to Rome and sent to a grammarandarhetoric
school, the former being under the management 01 one of the most cele·
brated teachers of the day, Remmius Palaemon ⁸, the other 01 Virginius
Flavus, a rhetorician of eminence, who was afterwards exiled by Nero ⁴.
He tooktbe ‘toga virilis’ at sixteen, the usual age, and according to
custom left school and went, as we should call it, to a private tutor, L.

⁶ ‘Diripere' See note on J nv. vi. 404, “ quis diripiatur adulter.”

⁷ This contradicts the other statement, that he died an. eucharis near the end 01
his twenty-eigbth year. This clause is not from the original, but added hythe oom-
piler in ignei-auce.

⁸ What follows is out 01 order, aud probably made up by the oompiler.
