SATIRA VIII. ’ 189

acrooked girl Europa, a mengy doge pard, a tiger, or a lion. So γοα had better

not affect great names.

V. 39. This is for you, Rubellius Plautus, swelling with your descent from Drusus, as
if it were a merit of your own that γοα were bom not of a poor weaver but cf the
great Iulus’ blood. “Low wretches (say you), ye who cannot tell your father²s
birthplece. Iam a son of Cecrops l '' Iaong may γοα live ιο eujoy your birth! But
in that low rabble you will find a man of eloquence, who shall defend some noble
bloclchcad, or solve the riddles of the law γ and somebrare soldiers too; while you are
all Cecropiam as useless as a Hermes 3 the only diderence is his betd's of marble,
yours has life iu it. Tell me,0 Trojau, who connts animale noble except tbcy're
brasc? We praise a horse for speed who bas wcn many races easily. Whereyer hc
was reered we call him noble who beru the rest, while a mere herd to be put up aud
sold are the best bred if they but seldom win. 'I'here we have no respect for
ancestry : they sell for little and go ιο druw ecurt orgrind a mill. So tell me some·
thing of your own to engrave upon your bust, besides the honours that wc freely
give to those to whom you owe all that you have.

V. 71. hluough for him, who lacking common sense (rare in that state of life) is puffed
with his relationship to Nero. But yon, my friend, I would not have you valued
upon the merite of your family, and γοα yourself dc nothing forfuture time to praise.
’I'is poor to rest upon another’s fame ς remove the pillarand the roof falls in; robbed
of its clm the vine comes to the ground. Be a good soldier, honestguardinn, upright
judge, witness insenuerunt not your life before your character, your life before
the cause for which γοα live. 'l'hat man deserves to dic, though he fare sumptuously
and srnell of all perfnmes.

V. st. When γοα have got the province thet γοα look for, put reins upon your temper
and desis-es ς pity the poor retines, the princes γοα will see have all thc marrow
suched from ont their boum. 'Iliiuk of the lews, the trust committed to youths
honours that aweit the good, the fate of those who were condemned for robbing the
Ciliciam. Not thetsucb condemnation is worth much, when one takes what another
leaves. uo, get an auctioneer ιο sell your clothes, Chaerippus, and straight say
nothing3 it were mere madness to throw away your faro besides.- 'l'hose people
suffered less when they were beaten first: riches were lefb them still, shawls and
dresses, picturas and statues, and chased silver vessels ς then caum your governors
and carried off more spoils from peace than ever graced a triumph. Now the little ·
that they have they’ll lose it all. Yon may despise perhaps the Rhodiaus and Corinth
too ; hut take good care of Spain, of Gaul, Illyricum, the Africana who send ns corn
ιο feed our idleness. Resides they've nothing to repcy yon, Marius has robbed them.
'laha carc you do no great wrong to the breve aud poor: tale all they have, γοα
still will leave them arms. r

V. 125.,This is no saw ς believe the Sibyl speaks. Be your attendants righteous, no
favourite sell your judgments, your wife uo harpy, then you may trace your birth to
Picus and the 'lituu brood, end claim Prometheus for your ancestor. But if ambition,
lust, and cruelty carry you hcadlong, then your encoetors only hold up the torch to
expose your shame. The sin is greatest in the greatest sinner. Why bosst yourself
ιο mc, γοα who forge wills in temples which your grandsire built, before your fathers
statue, and steal hy night to eu adulterous bedf

V. Ill. Fut consul Lateranus drives his coech right past the ashes of his sires by night,
but the moon and sters look on, and when his consulship is done he'll do it in broad

’ day and meet his aged friend without a blush. He’ll do grooms’ work, und when he
goes to sacrifice to Jove he'll swear by Epona and stable gods. And when he goes to
taverna the greasy host comes out to meet him, and with an air salutes his lordship3
while the officione hostess brings the asine.
