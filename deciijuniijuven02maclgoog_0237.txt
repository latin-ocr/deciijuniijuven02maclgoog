188 D. JUNII IUVENALIS

SATIRA VIII.

INTRODUG'I'ION.

ΤΗΙ vice oi aristocratic protensiori is here represented with moderation and good sense.
'l'here is no idle declamation against hereditery honours, but the blindness of men
belonging to en exclusive cluss, whose eleims ιο distinction were founded upon the
merite oi the greot end good of former generations and nnsnpported by any persensi
merite oi their own, is shown in lunguage which nc one cen object tc, and reasoning
which admits oi no enswer. 'Ihe nobility of emen’s encestors, he says, only holds ι
torch up to his shame ii he live unworthily of thern. 'I'he more exalted is the guilty,
the more conspicuous is his gnilt. 'I'he only true nobility is virtue, and the virtuous
nobleman is a nobleman indeed. 'l'he rece-horse, ii he show no signs of his descent, is
set to grind or drew a cert. Among the despised plebeians there ere those who have
great gitis aud virtues, end heve rendered great services tc the nohility and to their
country. 'l'hcse are the commonpluces of the Setire, which also exposes some oi ιιο
particular vices among the patriciensof the dey, among which were gambling, keeping
low company et teverns, a passion for driving and ior ιιο stables, acting in public,
hiring themselves ior gladiatore, but above all grcss maledministration in ιιο
provinces, against which Juvenal taines peins to cantion his friend, Ponticus, to whom
the Setire is eddressed in the form of an Epistle. He is one of the class against
whose degenerete meinhers the Satire is directed; und we moy suppose ιο wasa

young man with what we should eall good prospecte. I thinlr a reel person must Ἴ
heve been meent, and thet the poem is not a mere declamation. Heinrich inquires ¹

whether the subject was suggested by real life cr the rhetorical schoois, and thinks
the poem was drawn froin both sources. 'lhere wes enough in real life ιο suggest
it, es there would he still and perhaps rnore; and we need not,I think, go tc ιιο
schools ior its inspiration. 'I'he pride of birth and the degeneracy of inherited nobility
were not new features οι society in J nvenal's time, and they have not grown soold
in onrs hut that generations to come will complsin as he did, and pcnr contempt,
as he did net, on the inheritance of noble names, however virtuous their posessors
moy be.

There are some severe lines on the Emperor Nero (211-226), and the Setire was
written at’oer his time, ss the context shows ; bnt how long it is impossible to say.

ARGUMENT.

What use are pedigrees, οιοοιιιι] blood, statues and images, and noble nomes, ii in
