As in the case of Horace, there has been collated a sufficient num-
ber of good MSS. of Juvenal to supply a satisfactory text without
resorting to conjecture; and I believe there is authority from MSS.
or scholia for all the readings I have adopted. That MS. to ‘which

Buda, in Hungary. Where it is now, is unknown. . It is referred

towards the end of the sixteenth century, our knowledge of it

From this MS. copious scholia were published by these editors, “
and they are referred to generally as ‘the Scholiast' in this and
