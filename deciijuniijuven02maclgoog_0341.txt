293 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

V. 86. Some sey chance goverus ull things, nature rules the world, end so thcyfesrless
go to suy altar. Others believe in gods and punishment, but argue thus: “ Les them
do with my body what they will, sud strike me blind, so thet 1 keep my gains We
may bear ull for that. Ladas if poor will prey for the rich nran's gout, unless hehe
insane. The racer's barren erown, what does he get by thet? The gods may punish,
but they punish slow : my turn willnot beyet ς besides it may be they will pardon ωας
the fault is veniel. It'sall scheme, one gains a creas byhis crimes audone n crown.'’
”lis thus they quiet conscience, put u bold face upon it, go to the alter of their our
accord, abuse or beet you for mistrusting them, und get believed for their uudneity.
And so they cet their force, while you cry out with voice like Stentor or like hlsrs,
‘⁶ Jove, hesrest thou in silence? Why do we bring thee sacrifice and incense? As

· far ss I cen see your statues are no better than ngellius'.'’

V. 120. Now telle such comfortas you may from one unreed in all philosophy. Patienti
in danger may consult grest doctore, do you submit to u humbler. If you een prore
there never was a crime so bed in sll the world, I hold my peace, mourn as you

, will 3 I know the loss of money is e greater grief then loss of kindred3 in that case

, mourning is notfeigned,thetesrssre real. But if it'severy wherethesemethat meu
deny their houd und seul, are you,'fiue gentlemen, to be excepted? How do you make

thing atter ell if you compare it with the greater crimes, the hired assessin, the incen-

disry, the saerilegious robbcr who plunders temples, or the petty thief who seraper
the gold from statues ς the poisouer, the parricide. How small a pert is this of all

Δ the crimes the praefeet listens to from morn till night! His court alone will teach
you what men ere. Spend e few days there und talk sbout your miser-y if you
dere. ’

V. 162. None wonder st swelled throets in the Alps, course breasts in Egypt, or blus
eyes end yellow curly hsir in Germany, because they are ell the sume. So nc one
among the pigmies laughs st their battles with the crsnes, though they ere onlyr
fect high.

V. 174. “But must not perjury und fraud be punished P'' Suppose him carried off end

Ι put tc death, your loss is still the sume, end ull you get is odium and e drop of blood
shed ¹from u hesdless corpse. ,

V. 180. “ Oh! but revenge is pleasanter then lifes? 'l'his is fools' language, who hare
up for nothing. Chrysippus, Thales would not say so, nor Socrates, who would not
share his cup of poison with his enemy. Philosophy corrects our fanlts of nature and
of practice: she first taught us right from wrong, for only little minds care for revenge,
us you msy see from women’s love of it.

V. 192. But why think they escape whom conscience whips? Their punishment is werre
than any down in hell, who night end day carry their witness with them. 'l'heSpurtsu
once temptod the orecle end got his ausser, which the event established, for he aad sll
his house though old heve perished. Such wss the penalty ofs bed desire. For hs
who thinlrs to do su evil deed incurs the guilt ss if he'd done the deed. tht iithe
man hes carried out his purpose? Ceaseless anxiety haunts him et meuls, perched
mouth, contracted brow ς bed dreems, through which the ultor-s he hes sworn by pau.
end your tall ghost most terrible of ull, end drives him to confession. ’Tis these
who trembleat the storm and think euch bolt e messenger of wrath. If one sturm
posses, then they seur the next, end tremble et the culm thet goes before it. Erery
disease they count e stone or dart from heaven. 'l'hey dure not sacrifleein
sickness3 what cen the guilty hope for? What viotim is not worthier to live theu
they?
