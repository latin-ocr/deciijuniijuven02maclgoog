SATIRA X.

Ad Phialen: tantum artificis valet halitus oris,

Quod steterat multis in carcere fornicis annis.

Ut vigeant sensus animi, ducenda tamen sunt aso
Funera natorum, rogus aspiciendus amatae

Conjugis et fratris plenaeque sororibus urnae.

Haec data poena diu viventibus, ut renovata

Semper clade domus multis in luctibus inque

Perpetuo moerore et nigra veste senescant. 215
Rex Pylius, magno si quidquam credis Homero,
Exemplum vitae fuit a cornice secundae.

Felix nimirum, qui tot por secula mortem

Distulit atque suos jam dextra computat annos

Quique novum toties mustum bibit. Oro parumper 250
Attendas, quantum de legibus ipse queratur
