D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ipse capillato diffusum Consule potat
Calcatamque tenet bellis socialibus uvam,

Delevit multa veteris fuligine testae3
Quale coronati Thrasea Helvidiusque bibebant

Brutorum et Cassi natalibus. Ipse capaces

Heliadum curstas et inaequales beryllo

Virro tenet phialas: tibi non committitur aurum3
