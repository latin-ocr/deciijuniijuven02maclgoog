A. PERSII FLACCI

Romulidae saturi quid dia poemata narrent.
Hic aliquis cui circum humeros hyacinthina laena est,

Rancidulum quiddam balba de nare loeutus,

Phyllidas, Hypsipyles, vatum et plorabile siquid,

Eliquat, ac tenero supplantat verba palato. 35

Naribus indulges: an erit qui velle recuset

Os populi meruisse, et cedro digna locutus

Linquere nec scombros metuentia carmina nec tus ?”
Quisquis es, o modo quem ex adverso dicere feci,

Non ego eum scribo si forte quid aptius exit, 45
