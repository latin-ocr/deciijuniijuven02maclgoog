108 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

among 111 And theu he wantsawifa 11 111 old stampl Bleed him, ye doctors.
A pretty follow! Go give 11111 to Juno 11 your wife is chaste= there are 111111
111 touch the crowns 11 Ceres, few whom their fathers would not loathe to 11111.
Well, go and wreathe the flowers about your door; your wife will with oue husband
be content,-nay sooner with one eye. We’ve heard, to be sure, 11 one who lived
chaste at her fathers country-place. But let her live so in the country-town: 111
grant you st her father's seat ς 111 who can tell what goes on there? Are Jupiter
and Mars 11 old?

V. 60. In all the porticoes and theatrcs 1111 you see one whom it were safe to wod? See
how they 11111 11 111 lascivious dance, and catch each sigh and leam it! Others
when theatres 111 closed get up their private plays. One likes 11111111 player,
one the comic, one the tragic actor, another spoils the siuger’s voice. What, do you
think any would love Quintilian? You marry that musicians may haget your
children, or your babe may show the 1111 11 111 mirmillo in his own. Hippia, the
senator's wife, went off to Egypt with 1 player ς and e’en Canopus cried shame on our
morals. Forgetful 11 111 home, the wretch, and country, her spouse, her sister, and
her sous, yea even gamas and Paris she abandoned. Nurtured in luxury, she
despised the sea3 her character she had despised before-a trifling loss among these
meltingdames. 111, she bore the dangers of so many reas3 but when 'tis duty calls
them, theu they tremble. 'I'hey're bold enough for sin, 11111 their husbauds bidthem
go on board, 'tis hard ς such nasty smells‚ they’re sich, the skies go round—their
stomach's strong enough when 'tis their paramours they follow. One vomits on her
husband, while the other dines with the sailors, wanders 11111 the decli, and pulla
the ropes. What was it charmed our Hippia so, that she could bear to be calleda
player’s 111111 Sergiolus was no boy, his face was ugly, his forehead scarred, a 111
upon hisnose, his eye 111 1111 dropping. But he was a gladiator ς this was his
beauty, 'twas 111 this she gave up 111. 'I'hey love the steel: let Sergius take the rudis,
aud he's no better than her husband.

V. 114. Why cere 111 private houses? hook at the rivsls of our gods, and hear what
Claudius had to bear. His strumpet wife stole from his bed, covered her head, and
with one slave girl went and took her stand by the brothel door, exposed her person,
told her price, and took whoever came, sad only when the time came round that she
must go.

V. 133. Why should I spealr 11 charms, philtres, and poisoned step-children? When
their sex's madness drives them, lust is their smnllest fault.

V. 136. Β11 why’s Caesennia virtuous, by her husband's showing? She brought himo
round sum, that’s what his testimony's worth: ’twas not the bow or torch of love that
won him, her money is the torch, her dos the arrows. He buya what liberty he has3
the greedy man’s rich wife 11 11 1 1111(1; before his face she nods and writes to ber
lover. Why does Sertorius love Bibule? Because she’s pretty. Three wrinklesa
hlack booth, a drier skin, and then, “Paclr up your baggage and begone,’' hc cries;
“ I'm tired 11 you, besides you wipe your nose. off with you! there's another coming
with dry nose.'' Τ111 then she's a hot tyrant; 11111111 the fiuest wools and wines-
nay that's but little-whole prisons full of slaves. Whatever’s to be had she huys 5
goes to thesaur, takes up the finest crystals, porcelain, diamonds‚ such as Agrippa
gave his sister.

V. 161. Butos so many is there not one good? Lot her have beauty, grace, wealth,
fertile womb, ancestors, chastity; be she 1 bird 111111111111111111,111111111111111
