SATIRA XVI.

Sidere. Plus etenim fati valet hora benigni,
Quam si nos Veneris commendet epistola Marti 5
Et Samia genitrix quae delectatur arena.
Commoda tractemus primum communia, quorum
Haud minimum illud erit, ne te pulsare togatus
Audeat 3 immo etsi pulsetur, dissimulet nec
Audeat excussos Praetori ostendere dentes, 10
Et nigram in facie tumidis livoribus offam,
Atque oculum medico nil promittente relictum.
Bardaicus judex datur haec punire volenti
