SATIRA Ι.

lNTRODUCTION.

· Tus object of this satire is to ridicule the literary taste of the day. Tho poet begins
witha verse supposed to be taken from a poem of his oum, which he begins repeatingto
a friend. The friend tells him no one will read his poetry; aad this gives him oceanea
to express his contempt for public opinion and his reasons for despisiug it; which are,
that while every body must write and spout, every body writes and sponte for effect, aud
none are satisfied without vulgar applause. So men write lewd verses to catch wauton
ears, and mincing stuff to plesse the delicate critics. 'l'he man upon his trial is not
satisfied unless the court applaudhis eloquence. Andwhat is this applause? The rich
man hus it of course, while behind his back he is only laughed at; aud whoevergets it
must be content to share it with the feeblest drivellers, and to earn it by panderiug to
a vicious taste, and avoiding all offeuce to the grem people. He appeals at last tutha
admirere of the worthies of the old Greek eomedy-“ Eupolis atque Cratinus Aristopha-
nesque poetae ’'—and is ready to abide by their judgment.

We cannot rightly infer from this that Persius had written or had not written iu
any other style than satire. ‘ihs opening verse is not one he would have chosen ssa
specimen of his style if he wished to produce something very good, aud it is plainly
only made for the occasion It is neither very good nor very bad. It is a specimen of
the morbid school of sentimental poetry, and reminds us of the celebrated parody of
Byron iu the Rejeeted Addresses, “ Where nought is every thing, and every thing is
nought ;’' aud though it is not impossible that Persius may heve suffered for some of
his juvenile productioris, as our poet had suffered before he wrote the English Bards
and Seotch Reviewers, in which the spirit of this satire is sometimes seen, there is uo
necessity for supposiug it was written under sach provocation.

The form in which it is written, involviug frequent interruptions and many supposed
speakers and several quotations from poems of the day and opposing sentimenta aud
criticisms, constitutes the chief difficulty of the satire. I have tried to make these
matters plain, but Ι have had to differ in turn from the other commentatore, sometimes
agreeing with one and sometimes with another. Any one who tries to read the satire
without a great deal of study aud without help, will see how difficult it is to follow tha
argument and to determine the arrangement. The allusione are soon disposed of, and
do not constitute the chief difficulty in reading Persius.
