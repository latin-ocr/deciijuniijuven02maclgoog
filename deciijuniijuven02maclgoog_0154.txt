SATIRA VI. 107

eherished the one were the shameless acenes of tha other. Extravagance without
generosity‚ and driven on by mad lust, brad eovetousness, and eovetousness uiurder, ro

language which bas the air of extravagance, but may nevertheless be accepted 00 true,
not only from the testimony of other writers, but from the nature 01 110 case, the known
character of tha women, the legal 001 000101 position of the slave, and moreover the
experience (perhaps in more exceptional cases) of modern times. The love of personal

01 110 many monstrans features of this satire, in which there are no traces of those
crimes which are usually associated with the nobler passione in women, jaalousy,
disappoiuted love, ambition; but allis gravelling, filthy‚ depraved, and despicably
meran.

The date 01 110 satire has been fixed by some 10 Trajan's reign, 00 about 01). 106.
The arguments are derived from the allusione 10 110 Armenian king in v. 407, and to

that the poem could 001 have been written before his reign, which the nature 01 11
