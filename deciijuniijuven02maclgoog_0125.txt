78 D. J UNII JUVENALIS

V. 75. The word is given ς Pegasus first snstches up his closk, the new-made bailiff of

the city, for whst elsethen were praefecte? en excellent judge, but much too merciful
forthe times he lived in. Pleesant old Crispus next, whose beart was like his speech,
a men of gentle temper: en excellent compenion ior the world’s master if he might
speak his honest mind. But who dere speek to such a tyrant, when on every trivial
sentence hung one's life? Crispus was not theman to swim against the stream, and
risk his life for truth. And so be lived in safety eighty years. Thon came Acilius
with his poor son, unworthy of thet sevage death. But greatness and great age have
long been strangers. het me be humble brother ol the ginnts. In vain he pierced
the beer in the Albnn circus. Who does not see through such patricisn tricks?
Brutus might cheat your king with a' long beard. Rubrius eomes next, not lese de-
jected though less noble ς convicted of an old end foul offence, but shameless us the
fllthy satirist. Montanus next with his big belly comeo. Crispinus with his morning
scents: Pompeius too, whose soltestwhisper wss edugger: Fuscus, who dreemt of ware
in his marble villo, and kept bis bowels for the Daoian vultures. Cresty Veiento then,
and blind Catullus who lusted iore maid he could not see ς a special monster even for
ourtimes, nabutte beg by the road side. He matches all in admiration, looking to
the leo while the brute lay on his right ς just ae he did in the theatro, praisiug the
lighters and machinery. Veiento like a mndman prophesies. “Here is an omen of
hugo triumph 3 some king shell be your prisoner ; don'tyousee the brute’s a foreigneri’”
Fabricius could ull but tell the animal’s country and its age.

V. 130. “ Well now, what think ye, is it to be cut ?” “Nay,” seys Montanus, “far be
such disgreoe. Let’s get anobledish to put it in; Prometheus too to make it ; haste,
clay and wheel; henceforth, Ο Caesar, potiere must weit upon your court !” His
motion was adopted, worthy of a man who knew the ways of Nero’s court, no one
has beat him in my time for knowledge of the table. He’d tell you et a teste where
an oyster came from, and told et sight the echinus’ native coest.

V. lte The council rise and ere discharged; summoned in haste, as il' some terrible
news had· come from fer. Would that in tribes sneh as these had passed the savage ¹
days in which he robbed the city of her noblest spirits, without e hand to arengo
them. But his time eamewhen the mean began to seer him. ’Twusthis that ruined
him, though his hond reeked with noble blood.

Ecce iterum Crispinus, et est mihi saepe vocandus
Ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemptum

A vitiis, aeger solaque libidine fortis:
