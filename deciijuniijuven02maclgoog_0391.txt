dies, was acted publicly the other day.

V. 32. Two neighbouring peoples, Ombites and Tentyrites, have long fallen out with ¹

deadly hatred, only for this, that each maintaiu there 000 00 other gods 10111000 they
worship. It was 0 holiday at Ombi, a fit occasion 100 110 enemy, who were resolved
10 00011 11010 seven-days' apert (100 these barbatiane 010 0111 the infamans Canopus in ¹
good living) ι 001 they expected easy victory when they were dreuehed with wine. 00 '
one side there was dancing, dovera, perfumes ; 00110 01100, hatred and 00 empty belly.
Tirst they begin abusiug with hot cournge; thiais the trump 01 battle. ’1100 they
charge with mutual shont: their weapons are their fists; scarce any cheeks were leit
without a wound, or any nose unbroken. Faces contused you’d see throughout the

host, eheeks 10001 001 bones all starting through 110 0110, flstsreeking with the blood χ

01 eyes kuocked out. But this is ehild's play ε what nse issuch a crowd 01 combatauts
11 0000 are killed? 80 they grew fiercer aad throw stenes, not such as Turnus, Ajax,
or Tydides threw, 101 0001 as meu cau wield in these degenerate days, when all 000
bad and puuy, so that heaven hughe at men and hates them.

V. 72. But 10 return. One party reiuforced get bold 001 ply the swerd and bow, tha
other fly and Tentyra pursues. 000 01100 001 falls in his haste; they take him pri-

ment! I'm sure you must be happy it escaped! But they who ate had neveramure
pleasant meal. Don't think it was the 1001 10-010 only that was sweet ; the last man
when the earease was all gone scraped 00 110 blood and licked it from his flugers.

V. 93. The Vascones they tell us lengthened life by 1001 like this: but that was 100· ’

tune’s spite aud wsr’s extremity, a long bloekade and famine. Such esses 000 should
pity, when after all their 1001 10 geue 10 110 1001 11010 01 grass, men eat each other,
as they would themselves: these gods and meu may 000100, as the ghosts would do
0111000 they've eateu. Zeno may tcaeh us all things must not be 1000 0000 100 life ;
101 how should they be 810100, 001 1101 10 011 Metellus’ time? Now all the world
have got our learning aud 110 Greek 100. Gaul 1000100 Britain how 10 01001 001
Thuletalks 01 hiring soonarhetorician. But yet that uoble people and Saguntum 101
some excuse 100 what they did. But Egypt was mere sarage than the Taurie altar;
forthere (11 we’re te trust the story) 110 goddess only sacrificedthe men aud nothing
more. What led these people 10 11010 crime, what accident, hlockade, 0010001001
8000000 110 Nile had left the country dry, what greater 100011 could they show thegudi
The Cimbri, Britoues, and Scythians were 00000 yet οο savage as this useless cuwardly
herd, who swarm upon the river in their painted beata. Ne punishment is 1001
enough 100 those whose passion is as bad as famine.

V. 181. Nature has given soit hearts 10 men, 0010000 will prove. She bids 0000000100
friends 10 sorrow, for the poor wretch ou trial 100110 1110, 00 boy that brings his
1000101001 guardian 10 justice, whose weeping face and streaming hair might ben
girl's. She bids us weep when a young maiden dics or little 1010. What good man
andtrue but eouutsallhuman miseries 110 own? ’Τ10 thisdistinguishes us meu from
beasts; for this we’ve minda to take 10 things divine aud erereise all arts3 and sense
from heaven, which they have 001 who look down 00 110 earth. They'vc breath but
we have spirit, 00 1101 sympathy bids 00 seek rnutual help, jolu in comrnnnities, and
quit the woods 000 fathers lived in, 10111 heuses, jein our habitatione 100 mutual
safety‚ stand by each other and protect the fallen, fight altogether at 000 signal, share
the same walls and towers. But now the snakes are more harmonicus than we 00ος
110 wild beust preys not on his kind : bnt as forman 'tis not enough to have ferged
the fatal swerd, though the first smitbs knew only to make tools. But now we see
whole peoples not content with killing iu their passion, 101 they must eat each other.
