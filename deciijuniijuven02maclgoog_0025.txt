xx INTRODUCTION. ’

Τ155, or soon afterwards, Juvenal was allowed 1ο give up his command
and return to Rome, being at the time 51 his return about forty years 51
age. Martial’s epigram proves that he was not altogether independent
or comfortable about this time. Nerva reigned less thau two ysara, and
Trajan succeeded to the empire An). 98, and 15 115 early part 51 115
reign, soon atter Aa). 100, Juvenal first published a volume of Satires
(51 which the first in our collection was one), having already recited them
to large audiences. It 15 551 unlikely that some 51 11555, or parts of
them, had been composed in the reign of Domitian ¹, or even earlier, but
that the poet had not ventured to make them public. He continued 15
write freely during Trajan’s reign, which ended 55). 117, when Juvenal
was about sixty, and during the early years 51 Hadrian’s reign, that is,
1111 about Ab. 120. During this reign he may have lived in comfort
through the hberality 51 115 emperor, though his household was ou a
frugal scale, as he 15115 us in Sat. xi, from which (v. 65) we learn that
he had property at Tibur. It is not impossible he may have lived till
the accession 51 Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian 55, 138, when
Juvenal was, according 1511115 515151, eighty or a little more.
Thus the statements 51 115 Grammarians in respect to the poet's age,
. and 51 1151 writer who says he died 51 511 age in the time 51 Α51551555
Ρ155, would be borne out. I have also allowed the 155151 55 honour·
‘able banishment into Egypt, though not the cause assigned by the
Grammarians, which is impossible. That Juvenal ‘did not professedly
⁸ compose satire till late in life, is admitted and accounted for. Likewise
ἱ 1151 he may have written verses before he ventured to publish them,
and that some 51 11555 were afterwards incorporated with his Satires, is
allowed. Itis 5155 admitted that he attended the usual schools in early
life, and 'practised rhetoric till middle age. Beyond these facts the
Grammarians Ι believe have been misled‚ probably by mistaken infer-
ences drawn from allusions in the Satires themselves, a fertile source 51
error and 51 pretended learning on the part 51 115 Scholiasta 55 all tho
ancient authors.

The 1551 51 115 banishment, though allowed as 551 being chronolo-
gically impossible, I nevertheless think isan error, but an early 555, as
is proved by a verse quoted from Sidonius Apollinaris, who believed the
whole story, including Paris' share in it. He wrote about the middle 51
115 fifth century, and says (Oarm. ix. 270, sqq.):

“Non dui tempore Caesarissccundi
Aeterno coluit Tomos reatu (i. e. Ovid);
Nec qui consimili deindo casu,

Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis auram,
irati 15111151515515 exul.''
