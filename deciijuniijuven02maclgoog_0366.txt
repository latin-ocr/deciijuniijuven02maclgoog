SATIRA XIV. 317

Ει cana monstrante gula. Quum septimus annus 10
Transierit puero, nondum omni dente renato,

Barbatus licet admoveas mille inde magistros,

Hine totidem, cupiet lauto coenare paratu .

Praecipit, atque animas servorum et corpora nostra
Materia constare putat paribusque elementis,

An saevire docet Rutilus, qui gaudet acerbo

Plagarum strepitu et nullam Sirena flagellis

Comparat, Antiphates trepidi Laris ac Polyphemus, 20
