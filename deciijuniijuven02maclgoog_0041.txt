xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

to be interpolatione, and his judgment on them may be vidwed as a
challenge to all those who maintain that they are genuine. His repu-
tationes a critic will depend on his success or failure in establiehing
hie opinion. The fourth Satire, ae it stands, hae an introduction of
thirty-six verses, which have been added, as Ribbeck assumes by
sorno unskilful hand. He is not the first critic or reader who has felt
some surprise at finding a long Prologus to nothing, for the first thirty·
six lines have no connexion with the real subject 01 the Satire, though
there are critice who admira this ¹Prologue and think it is appro-
priate and 0 fine piece of composition. Tha beginning 01 the Prologus
announces that Crispinus ie again brought on the stage, and the writer

declares his intention to summon him often to play his part. We
expect that we are going to read a terrible invective against the fellow;
but after a few general remarks about hie villany, we are told that the
present Satire will only treat of his emaller offences, and then comes the

particular charge against him of buying a fish at an enormoue price,
and eating it himself. The mention of the fish ie supposed by the
admirere of the Prologus to be a elever way of connecting the intro-
duction with the real Satira, the subject 01 which is the great fish that 1
was presented to Domitian. But what becomes of Crispinus after thie
flourish? He plays a most -insignificant part in the scene before the
Emperor, and says not a word about the big fieh, though something
would have been very much to the purpose from a man who was 0
buyer of fieh, and in his early days cried them· through the streete of
Rome. If Juvenal wrote this Prologus 10 the Satira, we cannot
commend his taste. Ribbeck goes into particulare, and examines
various parte of this Prologue⁴in order to confirm his general cou- 3
damnation of it.

The other long passage, which Ribbeck 110010 00 an interpolation, ie
the Introduction of fifty-five lines whioh is prefixed to the eleventh
Satire. This Introduction resemblce thet to the fourth Satire in this
respect, that if you cut it off, you lose nothing 01 the real Satire, which 1
is an invitation to a friend to come and dine with Juvenal. This·
friendly epistle is a charming composition, and reminds us, as Ribbeck
observes, 01 Ηο1000’0 humour and genial temper. If Juvenal wrote the
Prologus, he would have dono better if he had commenced· his epistle
at once without 0 preface.

This Eseay 0100 00110110 0 short chapter on verses which have been
transposed in Juvenal's text, and on the passages where something
appears to have been lost. The last chapter, written in Latin, is on 1
the famous sixth Satire, the disorderly arrangement of which the learned
critic has attempted to correct.
