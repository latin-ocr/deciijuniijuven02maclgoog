320 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Turpe paras, ne tu pueri contempseris annos,

Sed peccaturo obsistat tibi filius infans.

Nam si quid dignum Censoris feeerit ira eo

Quandoque et similem tibi se non corpere tantum

Nee vultu dederit, morum queque filius et qui

Quum facias pejora senex, vacuumque cerebro

J am pridem caput hoc ventosa cucurbita quaerat?
Hospite venturo cessabit nemo tuorum.
