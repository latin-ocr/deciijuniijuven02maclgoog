SATIRA IX.

INTRODUCTION.

'lma satire will not be read with any pleesure. lt is nevertheless written with much
power. It is a dialogus between two acquaintancea one of whom hus been making a
livelihood by the vilest services rendered to effeminate men. His friend expresses
surprise at his melancholy appearance, which he explains by the scantiness of his weges
end the hopelessness of his prospecte. 'l'he humour and severity of the satire cousist iu
the gravity of the men's complaints against Fortuna and against his filthy employa,
whom heupbraids with meanness and reproachfully reminds of the great eervices hehad
rendered him, particularly in getting him children, which he was unable to get for himself.
'l'hecheracter of injuredinnocence and unrequited industry which theman actsthrougb·
out, and the affected serioueness of the friend's sympathy eud counsel‚ are sufficiently
amusing. But the subject isdisgusting, end only the surpassing iniquity of the ago
¹ could have justified the author to himself fordevoting another satire to it. 1 have guen
no argument.
