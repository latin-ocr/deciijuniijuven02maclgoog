Nay, Ι must laugh; my spleen is wauton.

V. 13. We all must write, oue verse, another prose. Such is the trash that, comhed und
ringed, with leering eye, a man will spout before the people, tickling their wauton
blood. What you, old wretch, purvey such food ior struugers' ears, that they may

V. 44. If 0101 hy 1 lucky chance I write 1 tolerable thing 01 two, I refuso not praise;
my liver is not hard. All I deny is that the end of life and limit of all good is that
applause of yours. Examine it and 100 what it contaius; the Iliad of Accius, 111 the
stuff that great men make 11 11111ος 101 how should-they get truth from their poor

Some newa-days like Accius and Pacuvius3 aud? when hlind fathers teach their

V. 114. Lucilius lashed the town and Flaccus laughed at them; must I not mutter e'er
