SA'l'IRA V.

Nescio quid tecum grave cornicaris inepte,

Nec stloppo tumidas intendis rumpere buccas:
Verba togae sequeris junctura callidus acri,

Ore teres modico, pallentes radere mores

Doctus et ingenuo culpam defigere ludo.

Hinc trahe quae dicas, mensasque relinque Mycenis
Cum capite etpedibus, plebeiaque prandia noris.''

Non equidem hoc studeo, pullatis ut mihi nugis
Pagina turgescat, dare pondus idonea fumo. ao
Secreti loquimur, tibi nunc hortante Camena
Excutienda damus praecordia, quantaque nostrae

. Pars tua sit, Cornute, animae tibi, dulcis amice,
Ostendisse juvat: pulsa, dignoscere cautus
Quid solidum crepet et pictae tectoria linguae. ss
