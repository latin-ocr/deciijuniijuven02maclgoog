let the plough gebus bread3 so shall we please the country gods, whose help and
favour got ns eoru for mast. That man commite no crimes who neers rough boots
and clothes himself iu hides. Ontlandish purple· lead to every crime.” Now all is
changed: the father wakes his son at midnight. “ Up, get ont your tablets,w1ite,
read, stndy law, petition for a centuriunship: let tho commender see γοα rough and
hairy. Ge light aud in your sixtieth year yon'll get the engle. Or if your contage
fails turn merchant, don’t be particular, stinking hides will do. Money smells sweet
wherever it may come from. The poet’s words be ever on your lips, well worthy of
the gods and Jove himself—⁴ whence γοα get no one aske, but get you must.'” This
is what narses teaoh, the boys aud girls learu this before their alphabet. WhenI
hear fathers urgiug thus their sons, 1 auswer, Fool, what need of all this haste? I
warrant youths pnpil will ontstrip his toacher. Mako yourself easy, he’ll snrpess
his father, as Ajax Telamon, Achilles Peleus. He’s young, when he begins ιο shave
he’ll sweer aud before mere trille. Woe to his wife if abeis rich! He knows a
shorter way to wealth than maging sea andland. (trime is no trouble. “I never
taught him this,'' you'll say some day. But you’re the cause of all his wickedness.
Who traina hisson to avarioe gives him the relus, und if he tries to check him he ι
refuses and, opums his driver and ιιο goel. He thinks it not enough ιο err as far as

, γοα will let him. Tell him the mau's afool who helps his friend, teach him ιο rob

· and cheat, by every crime get money, which γοα love as ever petriot loved his
country, andthen yon’ll seethe spark yourself have lighted blownto a fleme and carry
allbefore it: you’ll not escape yourself, the lion γοα have reared will teer his keeper.
Your horoscope is told, you say: bnt he’ll not weit, you'll die before your thread of
life is ont. He’s weary of your obstinate old age. Buy yourself antidotes, such as
kings and fathers should take before their meals.

V. 256. No play is half so good as to look on and see what risk they run ιο increase
their store. Can the petanrus or the rope-dancer amose us more than he who lives
nt sea, a wretched trafflcker iu perfumed begs or raiein wine from Cretei· Τιο
dancer does it for alivelihood, γοα ιαι for countless gold andhouses. The sea is firll
of ships3 more men there than eshore ς wherever gain may call them there they go.
A line return for all your toll, to come with full purae back and hoaut you’ve seen
the munstero of the deep. Maduess may vary, but that man is mad who fille his
ship and risks his life for silver cut in little heads and letters. 'lhe clouds are
loweriug, ‘¹ ’tis nothing,'’ eries the master, “ mere summer thuuder,’' and that night
perhaps his ship is wrecked aud he himself must swim for life ς and he who
thought the gold of Tagus and Pactolus little must beg in rags carrying his picture

So Alexander when ιο saw the man who made that tub his home, then learnt how
heppier far was ιο who wanted nothing, than he who coveted a world and went
through every toil ιο get it. All gods are there where Prudence is; 'tis we who

’ make Fortuna a goddess. lf any ask me what is the measure of a private fortune,
I tell them just as much as nature wants, or Epicurus for his little garden, or Socrates

yon, mix a little from our habits with the old. Maka up an eques' fortune: if that
be not enough, then two, or even three. lf that does not suffice, then willnot
Oroesns’ treasures or Persia's kingdom or Narcissus' wealth.
